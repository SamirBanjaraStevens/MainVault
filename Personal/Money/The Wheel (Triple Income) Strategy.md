## Introduction
- **Description**: The Wheel is a methodical, safe, and reliable options trading strategy.
- **Returns**: It may not offer astronomical returns, but it's consistent and can yield a 10% to 20%+ return.

## Objective
- Sell cash-secured Puts to collect premiums.
- Reduce the stock's initial cost basis using collected premiums.

## Process

### 1. Stock Selection
   - Essential to choose stocks you'd be comfortable holding long-term.
   - **Ideal stock criteria**:
     - Profitable company with solid cash flow.
     - Bullish or neutral chart trend.
     - Stock priced ideally between $15 to $100.
     - Stable chart movements.
     - Preferably stocks that pay dividends.

### 2. Selling Puts
   - Indicates the trader's readiness to buy the stock if it gets assigned.
   - **Sell puts based on a model**:
     - 30 to 45 days till expiration (DTE) for a good premium.
     - 70% probability of expiring out-of-the-money (OTM).
     - Number of contracts aligned with account size.
     - Track credits and debits.
     - Aim to roll the put if challenged, ensuring a net credit can be achieved.

### 3. Selling Covered Calls (if the stock is assigned)
   - Aim to sell calls above the net stock cost.
   - Adjust strategy if the net cost is above the current market price.
   - Continue selling calls to collect more premiums and lower the net stock cost.

### 4. Review and Repeat
   - Once the cycle completes, begin again with stock selection and continue the process.

## Potential Risks and Management
- **Stock Price Decline**: 
   - Choose stocks wisely to mitigate this risk.
   - If the stock price drops below the put strike, consider rolling for a credit.
   - Use covered calls to manage the situation.
- **Stock Price Increase**:
   - If the covered call strike is above the net stock cost, the position will profit, albeit less.
- **Impatience**:
   - Avoid closing positions prematurely.
   - Let positions play out to maximize profit potential.

## Tracking and Analysis
- Use a simple spreadsheet to monitor credits, debits, and stock prices.
- This aids in knowing the position status at any given time.

## Edits & Clarifications
- The strategy's goal is premium collection, not stock assignment.
- Selling puts repeatedly or rolling them for credit helps avoid assignment.
- Proper stock selection, diversified positions, and good account management are essential.
- This strategy differs from buying and holding stock due to options providing leverage and flexibility.

# Rolling Short Puts to Avoid Assignment

## Introduction
- The objective is to avoid assignments by consistently rolling short puts for a net credit.

## Rolling Strategy
- Roll when the stock price reaches the put strike and is likely to continue dropping.
- Aim to collect rich premiums when the option is at-the-money.
- Continue to roll, collecting more credits, until the stock recovers or another strategy is more suitable.

## Recovery Techniques
- Consider selling another short put to increase premium collection.
- With time and patience, most positions can be steered back to minimal loss or even profit.

## Considerations for Earnings Reports
- When an earnings report is impending, it's best to roll the option to at least 30 days past the report date.

# Additional Note on Delta Misinterpretation
- The actual chance is not strictly 30%; it's an upper bound.
- The assumption of a Wiener process might not always hold.
- The implied volatility (IV) assessment based on the market may not always align with realized volatility.
- Delta should not be solely interpreted as the probability of assignment.
