Hello 


I dont think ive had a single happy dream since october of last year. I've been struggling to be happy, not just happy but also able to feel calm, safe when i'm by my self. I keep having nightmares, from my past, whats going on in the future.

My time in the ward twice in fear of my own safe has forced me to retreat to the safest part of my mind. However it is the deepest and most secluded. I wish i could give you a key to save me, nay to come hang out with me. But i dont even know how to begin creating a key, i am not a black smit. As one would expect to be of their own mind. This experience i underwent still lingers as i have terible day now and then of though of harming my self. This feeling is foul. A creature. A dieses. When someone is in the hospital with a dises they have friends, family, their partneter there to support them. But i dont know how to let you in to be there for me. I feel disgusting, contagious. That my rotten soul will seep into your happy and joyful life and ruin you. This diseases feeds on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with abosuletly nothing but their corpse. But even within scattred bones, charred bodies, ashed dust the sadness and pain will last for ever. I feel like i want to leave this world beacuse i am bored of the pain and misery. Ive had enough. I feel like ive lived long enough. I want to leave with the world its worries and tribullations. I am not strong, i am not a strong man. 








Ive been crying out for help. For a warm hug, hot choclate, fall morning,   



For the sake of my survival, baptize me in a bottle of borboun, Chet Baker on a vinyl, and an

If your planning on leaving, dont come at all.
