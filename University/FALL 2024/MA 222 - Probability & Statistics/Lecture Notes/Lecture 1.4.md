Measures of Variability
***
Objectives:
- Compute the range, variance, and standard deviation
***
# Range
$$\text{ Range} = \text{Maximum Data Value} - \text{Minimum Data Value}$$

# Variance
## Population Variance 
$$\sigma^{2}=\cfrac{\Sigma(x_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N}$$
- $x_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ value in the population
- $\mu$ is the population mean
- $N$ is the number of values in the population

## Sample Variance
$$s^{2}=\cfrac{\Sigma(x_{i}-\hat{x})^{2}}{n-1}$$
- $x_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$  data value
- $\hat{x}$ is the sample mean
- $n$ is the number of data values in the sample

# Standard Deviation

- The *standard deviation* is a measure of how much we might expect a typical member of the data set to differ from the mean. It is the *square root of the variance*
## Population Standard Deviation 
$$\sigma=\sqrt{ \cfrac{\Sigma(x_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N} }$$ 

## Sample Standard Deviation
$$s=\sqrt{ \cfrac{\Sigma(x_{i}-\hat{x})^{2}}{n-1} }$$

# Properties of the Standard Deviation

- $s$ measures spread about the mean. 
	- Use $s$ to describe the spread of a distribution only when you use the mean to describe the center
- $s = 0$ only when there is no spread.
	- This happens only when all observations have the same value. 
		- So standard deviation zero means no spread at all
		- Otherwise, $s > 0$. As the observations become more spread out about their mean, $s$ gets larger.
