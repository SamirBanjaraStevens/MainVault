**Statistics**  - science of gathering, describing, and analyzing data

**Popluation** - Particular Group of Interest

**Sample** - Subset of the popluation from which data is collected

### Example 1: 
The campus coffee shop of a college wants to know if students have tried the new flavor in their menu. They surveyed 120 randomly chosen students and found that 46 have tried it. Identify the population and the sample for this study.

**Popluation:** College Kids on Campus
**Sample:** 120 Randonmly Chosen Students who were surveyed

### Example 2:
A personnel director is interested in determining how effective a new training course will be in improving the writing skill of her companyâ€™s employees. The director randomly selects 30 employees and determines their writing skill both before and after taking the training course. Identify the population and the sample for this study.

**Popluation:** Employees at company
**Sample:** 30 randomly chosen employees

***
**Variable:** 
	Independent: **value** or **charateristic** that is *being* **surveyed**
	Dependent: **value** or **characteristic** that changes among members of the *population*.

**Data:**  counts, measurements, or observations gathered about a specific variable in a population in order to study it.

**Census:** study with data from every member of popluation

###### Different types of Variable

**Univariate:** data set consists of observations on a single variable.

**Bivariate:** data when observations are made on each of two variables.

**Multivariate:** data arises when observations are made on more than one variable

### Branches of Statistics

**Descriptive Statistics:** 
- Gathers, sorts, summarizes, and displays the data
- Answers the questions such as,
	- Typical value?
	- How much variation?
	- Extreme values?
	- Shape or distribution of the data?
	- Relative position of a value in the data set?
	- Any relationships among variables? How strong is the relationship?

**Inferential Statistics:** Make reasonable guesses about popluation characteristics using sample data
***
**Before** we can **understand** what a particular sample can tell us about the population, we should **first understand** the *uncertainty* associated with taking a sample from a given population.

### Data Classification
**Qualitative Data** (Catagorical Data)
	Consists of labels or descriptions of traits
**Quantitative Data** 
	Consists of counts and measurements

Of the **Dependent** variable


### Conducting a Statistical Study
1) Determine the design of the study. 
	a)  State the question to be studied. 
	b) Determine the population and variables. 
	c) Determine the type of the study, the sampling method. 
2. Collect the data. 
3. Organize the data. 
4. Analyze the data to answer the question.

### Enumerative Study

### Analytic Study


## Ways to collect data
### Observational Study
* Observes data that already exist
* A representative sample has the same relevant characteristics as the population and does not favor one group from the population over another.
#### Sample Methods
##### Random Sampling :
Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

##### Simple Random Sampling :
Every Sample of the popluation has an equal chance of being selected

Simple Random sampling less biased than random sampling
#### 1st way: Simple Random Sampling
Popluation = Class (50 Students)
Randomly pick 5 students
Chance of being picked $\frac{1}{50} \times \frac{1}{49}\times \frac{1}{48} \times \frac{1}{47} \times \frac{1}{46}$

#### 2nd way: Not Simple Random Sampling
divide class in to halves (25 Student) (25 Student)
Randomly pick one of the two samples
Then randomly pick 5 students
chance of being picked $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{25} \times \frac{1}{24}\times \frac{1}{23} \times \frac{1}{22} \times \frac{1}{21})$

##### Stratified Sampling :
A few members from each stratum (or group) are randomly selected.
##### Cluster Sampling :
All members from a few randomly chosen clusters (group) are selected.
##### Systematic : 
Every nth member of the population is chosen.
##### Convenience Sampling:
The sample is chosen because it is convenitent for the researcher.
### Experiment
Generates data to be used in study
 * A **treatment** is some condition that is applied to a group of subjects in an experiment. 
 * **Subjects** are people or things being studied in an experiment. 
 * **Participants** are people being studied in an experiment. 
 * The **response variable** is the variable in an experiment that responds to the treatment.  (Dependent Variable)
 * The **explanatory variable** is the variable in an experiment that causes the change in the response variable. (Independent Variable)


## Stratifed Sampling
A few members from each stratum(or group) are randomly selected

## Cluster Sampling
All members from a few randomly chosen clusters (group) are selected.

## Systematic Sampling
Every nth member of the population is chosen.

## Convenience Sampling
The sample is chosen because it is convenitent for the researcher.
