During this week we study convergence and divergence properties of series and discuss examples beyond geometric series such as the p-series. By the end of this week students should be able to

- Recognize basic examples of series, such as geometric series and p-series and decide their convergence and/or divergence.
- Apply the
    -  Test for Divergence,
        - the Integral Test
        - the Comparison Test(s)
        - The Alternating Series Test
        - The Ratio Test

       as appropriate to decide divergence and/or convergence of the series under discussion.
