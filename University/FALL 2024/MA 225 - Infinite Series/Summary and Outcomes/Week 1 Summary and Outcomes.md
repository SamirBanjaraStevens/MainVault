In this week, we shall learn what **infinite sequences** are, define their convergence and see some examples of **convergent and divergent sequences.** Next we go on to study **infinite series**, learn their **convergence and divergence** properties and meet some major examples such as **geometric series** and **p-series**. 

**By the end of this week students should be able to**

1. Recognize infinite sequences and define their convergence properties.
2. Determine whether a given sequence is convergent, and if so, find its limit. 
3. Recognize basic examples of series, such as geometric series and p-series and decide their convergence and/or divergence.
