question 5
Determine whether the series is convergent or divergent. If it is convergent, find its sum. Possible answers: 'divergent' (without quotes) or the sum value.
$$\Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty}[(0.5)^{n-1}-(0.4)^n]$$

Question 6
Determine whether the series is convergent or divergent. If it is convergent, find its sum. Possible answers: 'divergent' (without quotes) or the sum value.
$$\Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty}(\cos 4)^n$$

Question 7
Determine whether the series is convergent or divergent by expressing $s_{n}$ as a telescoping sum. Possible answers: 'divergent' (without quotes) or the sum value.
$$\Sigma_{n=4}^{\infty} \cfrac{2}{n^2-1}$$
Question 8
Use the Integral Test to determine whether the series is convergent or divergent.
$$\Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty} \cfrac{3}{n^{\cfrac{1}{5}}}$$
