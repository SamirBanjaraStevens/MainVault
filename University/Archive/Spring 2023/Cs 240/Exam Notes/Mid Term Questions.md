**PART I** – DATA REPRESENTATIONS (10 pts)  
Assume that we have a machine where ints and pointers are represented using 16-bits. 
Answer the following questions.
***
1. What is the maximum signed positive integer that can be represented in this machine? Express the answer in hexadecimal only

2. What is the minimum signed negative integer that can be represented in this machine? Express the answer in hexadecimal only

3. Show the representation of -2 in this machine (note that the machine does two’s compliment arithmetic). Express the answer in hexadecimal only

4. Is it true that in this machine we will always get  
	a. (x+y)+z = x + (y+z) for all integers x, y and z  
	b. x + 1 > x for all integers x.
	- If the answer is false (in each case) provide a counter example. 
	- If the answer is true (in each case) make a reasonable argument to support your claim.

5. Express 0x45 in decimal
