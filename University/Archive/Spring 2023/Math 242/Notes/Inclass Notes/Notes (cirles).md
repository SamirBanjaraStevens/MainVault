general equation of a sphere as above, identfity the center and radious
1.  
$$(x - 2)^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (z + 1)^2 = 3^2$$
Center : $(2,0,-1)$
Radius: $3$

2. 
$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -4x +2z -4 = 0$$
Center : 
Radius

3. Show that the dollowing are equations od spheres and finds tis center and radious 
	1. $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -4x + 2y = 0$$
	2. $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 4x - 6y + 2z + 6 = 0$$

4. What is region in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is represented by the inequalities?
	1. $$1 <= x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 4$$

5. What would the graph of the following equation look like?
	1. $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x - y + 6 = 0$$
	2.
