the **trace** of a square matrix 
	denoted $\mathrm{Tr}(A)$
		is defined to be the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of $A$
			(only defined for a square matrix)

It can be proved that the trace of a matrix 
	is the sum of its (complex) eigenvalues 
		(counted with multiplicities)

Also $\mathrm{Tr}(AB)=\mathrm{Tr}(BA)$ 
		for any two matricies $A$ and $B$
	This implies that *[[Similar matricies]]* have the same trace.
		As a consequence one can define 
			the trace of a *[[Linear operator]]* mapping a finite-dimentional *[[Vector space]]* into itself
				since all matrices describing such a operator with respect to a basis are similar

## Trace as the sum of eigenvalues

Given any $n\times n$ real of complex matrix $A$, there is,
$$\mathrm{Tr}(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}$$
	where $\lambda_{1}, \dots, \lambda_{n}$ are the *[[Eigenvalue]]s* of $A$ 
		counted with multiplicity.

This me regarded as a consequence
	of the existence of the *[[Jordan canonical form]]*
		($A$ is always *[[Similar]]* to its *[[Jordan Form]]*)
		together with the similarity-invariance of the trace

## Applications

If a $2\times 2$ real matrix has zero trace
	its square is a *[[Diagonal matrix]]*

The trace of a $2\times 2$ *[[Complex matrix]]* is used to classify *Mobius transformations*

The trace is used to defined *characters* of *group representations*

The trace also plays a cental role in the distribution of *quadratic forms*
