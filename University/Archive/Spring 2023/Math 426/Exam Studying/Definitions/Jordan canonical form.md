The form of a matrix 
	indicating its eigen values
		and their algebraic multiplicities
***

An upper triangular matrix 
	of a particular form 
		called the *[[Jordan matrix]]* 
			representing a [[Linear operator]]
				on a *[[Finite-dimensional vector space]]*
					with respect to some *[[Basis]]*
Such a matrix has each non-zero off-diagonal entry equal to $1$ 
	immediately above the main diagonal (on the *[[Superdiagonal]]*)
		and with identical diagonal entries to the left and below them.
