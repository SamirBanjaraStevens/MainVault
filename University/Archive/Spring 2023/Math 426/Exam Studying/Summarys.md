The **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** 
	factorizes a given matrix into its constituent parts. 
The SVD process involves the following steps:

1.  Given an m x n matrix A, calculate the product of A and its transpose A^T to get an m x m matrix AA^T.
    
2.  Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix AA^T. The eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the column space of A, and the eigenvalues correspond to the singular values of A.
    
3.  Calculate the eigenvectors of the matrix A^TA. The eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the row space of A, and the eigenvalues correspond to the same singular values as in step 2.
    
4.  Arrange the eigenvalues in decreasing order, and form a diagonal matrix Sigma whose diagonal entries are the square roots of the eigenvalues.
    
5.  Normalize the eigenvectors from steps 2 and 3 to obtain the matrices U and V, respectively.
    
6.  The SVD of A can now be expressed as A = U Sigma V^T.
    

The matrix U is an m x m matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the column space of A. The matrix V is an n x n matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the row space of A. The matrix Sigma is an m x n diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the singular values of A.

The SVD process can be used for a variety of applications including matrix inversion, low-rank matrix approximation, and data compression.
