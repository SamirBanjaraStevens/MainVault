Calculate Transitive Closure 

$a$ can communicate to $b$ and $c$
both $b$ and $c$ can communicate to $d$
assume communication is one way, 

this can be described by the relation 
$R =\{(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d)\}$ 

we want to change the system so $a$ can communicate with $d$ and still maintain the previous system. 
- Described as 
	- Find the smallest relation $R^+$ which contains $R$ as a sub set $R \subset R^+$ 
	- and is transitive 
- Thus, $R^+ = \{(a, b), (a, c), (b, d), (c, d), (a, d)\}$  

Hence the **transitive closure** of $R$, 
- denoted by $R^+$ 
	- is the smallest transitive relation that contains $R$ as a subset

It follows that is $(a, b) \in S$ and $(b, c)\in S$ then, $(a, c)\in S^+$ 


$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ 
$S = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)\}$ be the relation on set $A$ 
- This is called the successor relation on $A$ 
	- since each element is related to its successor.

$S^+ = S$ 

$S = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)\}$
$SS = S^2 = \{(1, 3), (2, 4)\}$
$S^+ = S\cup S^2 = \{(1, 2) (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\}$ 
$S^2S = S^3 = \{(1, 4)\}$ 
- because $(1, 3)\in S^2$ and $(3, 4)\in S$
this shows that $S^3 \subseteq S^+$ 
Thus, 
$S^+ = S \cup S^2 \cup S^3 = \{(1, 2) (1, 3), (1, 4) (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\}$


Let $r$ be a relation on the set $A = \{\text{Kira}, \text{Frank}, \text{Lola}, \text{Sarah}, \text{Judy}, \text{Reuben}\}$ 

with the relation matrix, 
$$
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The matrix of the transitive closure $R^+$, 
- can be computed by the equation $R^+ = R + R^2 + R^3 + \cdots + R^n$.
	- By using the polynomial evaluation methods, 
		- we can compute $R^+$ with $n-1$ matrix multiplications:
			- $R^+ = R(I+R(I+(\cdots R(I+R)\cdots)))$ 
				- for example, if n = 3
				- $R^+ = R(I+R(I+R))$ 

We can make use of the fact that if $T$ is a relation matrix $T+T = T$ due to the fact that $1 + 1 = 1$ in boolean arithmetic.
- let, $S_k = R + R^2 + \cdots + R^k$ 
	- Then, 
		- $$\begin{aligned}R &= S_1\\ S_1(I+S_1) &= R(I+R) = R + R^2 = S_2\\ S_2(I+S_2) &= (R+R^2)(I+R+R^2)\\ &=(R+R^2)+(R^2+R^3)+(R^3+R^4)\\ &= R + R^2 + R^3 + R^4\\ &= S_4\end{aligned}$$
		- Similarly, 
		- $$S_4(I+S_4)=S_8$$
		- and by induction we can prove
		- $$S_{2^k}(I+S_{2^k}) = S_{2^{k+1}}$$
		- Each matrix multiplication doubles the number of terms that have been added to the sum that is currently computed. 


# **For our problem we have** 

Let $r$ be a relation on the set $A = \{\text{Kira}, \text{Frank}, \text{Lola}, \text{Sarah}, \text{Judy}, \text{Reuben}\}$

# **Q1.2**

In set notion, 
$$R^+ = \{(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4)\}$$


#  **Q1.3**

the **transitive closure** of $$S$$, 
- denoted by $$S^+$$ or $$S^*$$ 
	- is the smallest transitive relation that contains $$S$$ as a subset.

For our specific, problem, 
relation $$R$$ is the successor relation on set $$A$$. 

The **Transitive Closure** specifies an ancestral family tree, 
- if there is a edge between two vertices, then they are 
	- either a parent and child, 
	- grandparent, and child, 
	- or great grandparent and child. 

# **Q2.1**

$$A = \{c, d, e\}$$

so total # of equivalence relations on the set is $5$
$$R_1 = \{(a,a), (b, b), (c, c)\}$$
$$R_2 = \{(a,a),(b, b), (c, c), (a, b), (b, a)\}$$
$$R_3 = \{(a,a),(b, b), (c, c), (b, c), (c, b)\}$$
$$R_4 = \{(a,a),(b, b), (c, c), (a, c), (c, a)\}$$
$$R_5 = \{(a,a),(b, b), (c, c), (a, b), (b, a), (c, a), (b, c), (b, c), (c, b)\}$$ 


Each equivalent relation on a set yields a partition of that set in disjoint equivalence classes for a finite set. 
The number of equivalence relations is the number of partitions.

# **Q 2.2**

How many different partial ordering can we dine on the set $$A= \{\x, y\}$$?

$$A\times A = \{(x, x), (y, y),(x, y), (y, x)\}$$

partial order is reflexive, lets list the reflexive relations on $$A$$

$$R_1 = \{(x, x),(y, y)\}$$
$$R_2 = \{(x,x), (x, y), (y, y)\}$$
$$R_3 = \{(x,x), (y, z), (y, y)\}$$
$$R_4 = \{(x,x), (x, y), (y, x) (y, y)\}$$
- Due to antisymmetric property, we cant use $$R_4$$

so, there exist 3 different partial orderings for set $$A$$


# **Q 2.3**

How many different total orderings on set $$A = \{p, q\}$$?

$$A \times A = \{(p, p), (p, q),(q, p), (q, q)\}$$

Total ordering is 
- partial ordering and two elements of $$A$$ are comparable. 

so, 2 total orderings, 
$$\{p<q, \ q < p\}$$
