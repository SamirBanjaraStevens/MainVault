## **Question 2.1** 

- **Symmetric & AntiSymmetric & Transitive**

Let $R = \{\emptyset\}$ be a relation on a set ùê¥

Prove that
- if $A$ is non-empty, the empty relation is not reflexive on $A$ . 
- The empty relation is symmetric and transitive for every set $A$
Solution:

For a relation to be reflexive: 
- For all elements in $A$, they should be related to themselves.  $xRx$
	- Now in this case there are no elements in the Relation 
		- and as $A$ is non-empty no element is related to itself 
			- *Note:* Would also hold for $A = \emptyset$ 
			- But in that case the empty relation would be reflexive.
		- hence the empty relation is not reflexive.

So, As $A$ is not empty, there exists some element $a\in A$ 
- As $R$ is empty 
	- $aRa$ does not hold
- Hence $R$ is not reflexive
    
- Now for a set to be symmetric and transitive: 
- As these are conditional statements
	- if the antecedent is false the statements would be true. 
		- And as the relation is empty in both cases 
			- the antecedent is false 
		- hence the empty relation is symmetric and transitive.

## **Question 2.2**

- **Reflexive** & **Symmetric** & **Transitive** & **Equivalence Relation**
The complete relation $R = \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ 
defined on the natural numbers. 

Imagine that set $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5. \cdots\} \quad \text{where } a\in\mathbb{N}$ 
then, $$\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} = \begin{aligned}\{&(1,1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1,\cdots),\\ &(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, \cdots),\\ &(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, \cdots)\}\end{aligned}$$ 
Then the relation $R$ is **Reflexive**, 
- because diagonal entires exists for all elements $a\in A$ 
- $(a, a)$

The relation $R$ is **Symmetric**, 
- because $(a, b) (b,a)$ for all $a$ and $b$

Transitive 
- $(a, b)(b, c)\rightarrow (a, c)$ 

## **Question 2.3**

- **Transitive**

The relation $R$ on integers where $aRb$ means $(a-2)<b$ 

$a$ minus $2$ is less than $b$ 

then $b$ minus $2$ is less than $c$


hence aRc hold true?  yes Transitive


can $aRb$ and $bRa$ hold true? no, hence not symmetric
Definitely not reflexive






## **Question 2.4**

- **Reflexive** & **Transitive**

The relation $R$ on $\{w, x, y, z\}$ where $R = \{(w, w), (x, y), (x, w), (x, x), (x, z), (y, y), (z, y), (z, z)\}$

Reflexive, 
- Because it contains all (w, w),  (x, x), (y, y), and (z, z)

Symmetric
- Does not contain

## **Question 2.5**

- **Reflexive** & **Symmetric**

$aRb$ means $a^2 = b^2$

$a^2 = b^2$ is equivalent to $a = b$ , 

thus, it can only be reflexive, be the relation can only contian
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
(1, 1) & & & \\
& (2, 2) &  & \\
& & (3, 3) & & \\
& & & (4, 4) & \\
& & & & (5, 5)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$1^2 = 1^2$
$2^2 = 2^2$
$3^2 = 3^2$ 
thus, the relation  is reflexive. 

is it antisymmetric?
- the definition for 
	- **Antisymmetric :**
		- If $a = b$ whenever $(a,b)\in R$ and $(b, a)\in R$  implies $x = y$

Taking $a^2 = b^2$ we can say that the given relation for set of integers $Z$ is reflexive because $a^2 = a^2$ and $b^2 = b^2$ will always hold true.

The relation is symmetric as well because $a^2 = b^2$ and $b^2 = a^2$
- so $aRb$ and $bRa$ holds 

Not transitive.
