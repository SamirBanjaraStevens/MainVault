Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Express the **range** of each function using roster notation.

Note: roster notation means writing the elements of the set between curly brackets and separated with a comma. Just like the above.

Here is the ∅ symbol in case you need it.
# 1.1
f: A × A → ℤ × ℤ, where f(x,y) = (y, x).
{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}

# 1.2
f: A × A → ℤ × ℤ, where f(x,y) = (x-1, y+1).
{(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}

# 1.3
f: $2^{A}$ → ℤ. For X ⊆ A, f(X) = |X|.
{{1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}}

# 1.4
f: $2^{A}$ → $2^{A}$. For X ⊆ A, f(X) = X ∪ {3}.
{{3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}

# 1.5
$2^{A}$ → $2^{A}$. For X ⊆ A, f(X) = X - {2, 3}.
{∅, {1}}

# 2.1
f(z)=$z^{3}$–z
surjective

# 2.2
f(z)= $4z^{3}$ –2
Injective
Surjective
Bijective

# 2.3
f(z)=z⋅$\sin(z)$
surjective

# 3
Find a bijective function whose domain is the set of all integers and whose target is the set of all positive integers.
$$f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{+}$$

$$
f(n) = 
\left\{\begin{array}{lr}
2n, & \text{if } n > 0\\
-2n+1, & \text{if } n\leq 0
\end{array}\right\}
$$
