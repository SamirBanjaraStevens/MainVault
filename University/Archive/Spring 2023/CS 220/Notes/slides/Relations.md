Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
A **Binary Relation** from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A\times b$ 
- for a <u>Binary Relation</u> $R$ we have $R\subseteq A\times B$ 
- use use the notion $aRb$ to denote that $(a, b) \in R$ 
- and $a\underline{R}b$ to denote that $(a,b)\notin R$ 

When $(a, b)$ belongs to $R$,
- $a$ is said to be <u>related to</u> $b$ <u>by</u> $R$ 

Example: 
Let
$P$ be a set of people, 
$C$ be a set of cars, and
$D$ be the relation describing which person drives which car(s)

$$
\begin{aligned}
P &= \{\text{Carl}, \text{Suzanne}, \text{Peter}, \text{Carla}\}\\
C &= \{\text{Mercedes}, \text{BMW}, \text{Tricycle}\}\\
D &= \{(\text{Carl, Mercedes}),(\text{Suzanne, Mercedes}), (\text{Suzanne, BMW}), (\text{Peter,Tricycle})\}
\end{aligned}
$$
*Note:* 
Function $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ assigns a unique element of $B$ to each element of $A$

The graph of $f$ is the set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $f(a) = b$
Since the graph of $f$ is a subset of $A\times B$, it is a relation from $A$ to $B$

Moreover, for each element $a\in A$,
- there is <u>exactly one</u> ordered pair in the graph that has $a$ as its first element

Conversely, if $R$ is a relation from $A$ to $B$ such that every element in $A$ is the first element of one ordered pair of $R$,
- then a function can be defined with $R$ as its graph
	- This is done by assigning to an element $a\in A$ the unique element $b\in B$ such that $(a,b) \in R$ 

### **Relations on Sets**
A relation on the set $A$ is a relation from $A$ to $A$ 
- relation on the set $A$ is a subset of $A\times A$ 

*Example:*
Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ 

Which ordered pairs are in the relation $R=\{(a,b) \ | \ a<b\}$?
- *Solution:*
$$
\begin{aligned}
A\times A =
\{&(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4),\\
&(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4),\\
&(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4),\\
&(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)\}
\end{aligned}
$$
so, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
R = 
\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4),\\
(2, 3), (2, 4),\\
(3, 4)\}
\end{aligned}
$$

How many different relations can we define on a set $A$ with $n$ elements?
- A relation on a set $A$ is a subset of $A\times A$

How many elements are in $A\times A$?
- There are $n^2$ elements in $A\times A$
- The number of subsets that we can form out of the set with $m$ elements is $2^m$ 
- Therefore, $\huge{2^{n^{2}}}$   subsets can be formed out of $A\times A$ 

Hence, we can define  $\huge{2^{n^{2}}}$ different relations (subsets of $A\times A$) on $A$ 


### **Properties Of Relations** 

**Reflexive :**
if $(a,a)\in R$  for every element $a\in A$

which of the following relations (subsets) on $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ are reflexive?
$$
\begin{aligned}
R_1 &= \{(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4)\}\\
R_2 &= \{(1, 1),(2, 2),(2, 3),(3, 3),(4, 4)\}\\
R_3 &= {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}
\end{aligned}
$$
$R_1$ : No, $(2, 2)$ is missing. 
- $(a, a) \in R$ for every element $a\in A$ 
	- So $(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)$ need to exist in a subset for the relation to be reflexive.

$R_3$ : No, $(4, 4)$ missing

$R_2$ : Yes, this is reflexive subset because $(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) \subset R_2$ 

**Irreflexive :**
if $(a, a) \notin R$ for every element $a\in A$

**Symmetric :**
If $(b, a)\in R$ whenever $(a, b) \in R$ for all, $a, b\in A$ 

- **Antisymmetric :**
	- If $a = b$ whenever $(a,b)\in R$ and $(b, a)\in R$  implies $x = y$  
- **Asymmetric :**
	- If $(a, b)\in R$ implies that $(b, a) \notin R$ for all $a, b\in R$ 
		- *Note :* 
			- A relation is **asymmetric** if and only 
			- if it is both **antisymmetric** 
			- and **Irreflexive**
- Asymmetric = Antisymmetric + Irreflexive

**Transitive**
If whenever $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c)\in R$ then $(a, c)\in R$ for $a, b, c\in A$ 
- Are the following relations (subsets of $A\times A$) on $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ transitive?
$$
\begin{aligned}
R_1 &= \{(1,1), (1,2), (2, 2),(2, 1) (3,3)\}\\
R_2 &= \{(1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)\}\\
R_3 &= \{(2, 4), (4, 3), (2, 3), (4, 1)\}
\end{aligned}
$$

| $R_1$ |       |               |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| 1     | 2     | $\rightarrow$ |
| (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,2)         |
| (1,1) | (1,1) | (1,1)         |
| (1,2) | (2,1) | (1,1)         |
| (2,1) | (1,2) | (2,2)         |
| (2,2) | (2,2) | (2,2)         |
| (3,3) | (3,3) | (3,3)         |

So <u>are any ordered pairs</u> of the $3^{rd}$ <u>column missing</u>?
- **No,** Hence, $R_1$ is transitive relation 

| $R_2$ |       |               |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| 1     | 2     | $\rightarrow$ |
| (1,3) | (3,1) | $(1,1)$         |
| (2,1) | (1,2) | $(2,2)$         |
| (3,1) | (1,3) | $(3,3)$         |

Highlighted entries in column 3 are missing, from $R_2$ hence, this relation is not transitive.


*Question:*
How many reflexive relations can be defined on a set $A$?

*Sol:*
Relations are subsets of $A\times A$ that contain $n^2$ elements
therefore, different relation on $A$ can be generated by choosing different subsets out of these $n^2$ elements,
- So there are $\huge{2^{n^{2}}}$  total relations 

A reflexive relation, contains the $n$ elements $(a,a)$ for every $a\in A$ 
- consequently, we can only choose among the remaining $n^2-n = n(n-1)$ elements to generate reflexive relations whether they are in the relation or not, so there are 
	- $2^{n(n-1)}$ reflexive relations defined on set $A$ containing $n$ elements 

**Combining Relations** (was on test last semester)

The **Composite** of $R$ and $S$ 
- is the relation consisting of ordered pairs $(a, c)$ 
	- where $a\in A$, $c\in C$ 
	- and for which there exists an element $b \in B$ such that $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c)\in S$ 
- In other words 
	- if relation $R$ contains a pair $(a, b)$ 
	- and relation $S$ contains a pair $b, c$, 
	- then $S \circ R$ contains a pair $(a, c)$ 

*Example*:
Let $S$ and $D$ denote relations on $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ 

$$A \times A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
(1, 1) & (1, 2) & (1, 3) & (1, 4)\\
(2, 1) & (2, 2) & (2, 3) & (2, 4)\\
(3, 1) & (3, 2) & (3, 3) & (3, 4)\\
(4, 1) & (4, 2) & (4, 3) & (4, 4)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- $S = \{(a, b) \ | \ a < b\}$ - "a is smaller than b"
	- $S = \{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\}$ 

- $D = \{(a, b) \ | \ b = 5-a\}$ - "b equals $(5-a)$" 
	- $D = \{(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4,1)\}$

then, $S\circ D = \{(2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)\}$ 

**Remember** to work <u>from inside out</u> : 
- $D$ maps an elements $a$ to the element $(5-a)$ 
	- and afterwards $S$ maps $(5-a)$ to all elements larger than $(5-a)$
		- resulting in 

-$S\circ D = \{(a, b) \ | \ b > 5 - a\}$  or  $S\circ D = \{(a, b) \ | \ a + b > 5\}$  

Functions are just a special cases of relations
	Namely, those that map each element in the domain *onto*  exactly one element in the codomain

To convert two functions into relations is to,
- write them down as a set of ordered pairs


**Representing relations as matrices** 
set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
set $B = \{1, 2\}$

with $R = \{(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)\}$  

wherever there is a ordered pair of the relation input 1 in the matrix, 
- wherever there isn't a ordered pair, input 0 in the matrix.

So,
- row 2, column 1 
- row 3, column 1
- row 3, column 2
	- are all ones

size of matrix?
last element of set $A$ times last element of set $B$
- a $3 \times 2$ matrix

hence, matrix $M_R$ is given by
$$
M_R = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0\\
1 & 0\\
1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Closures of Relations

**Partial Orderings** 

sometimes relations define an order on the elements in a set.

- Definition 
	- A relation $R$ 
		- on a set $S$ is called 
			- a **partial ordering** or **partial order** 
				- if it is 
					- **Reflexive**
					- **Antisymmetric**
					- and , **Transitive**

Example : 

Consider the "greater than or equal" 
relation $\geq$  (defined by $\{(a, b) \ | \ a \geq b\}$) 
- Is $\geq$ a partial ordering on the set of integers?

- $\geq$ is **Reflexive**, 
	- for $a\geq a$ for every integer $a$. 
- $\geq$ is **Antisymmetric**,
	- because if $a\neq b$, then $a\geq b \ \cap b\geq a$ is false.
- $\geq$ is **Transitive**,
	- because if $a\geq b$ and $b\geq c$, then $a\geq c$ 

- consequently, ($\mathbb{Z}, \geq$) is a partially ordered set. 

Example : 
- is the "inclusion relation" $\subseteq$ a partial ordering on the power set of a set $S$?
	- $\subseteq$ is **reflexive** , 
		- because a $A \subseteq A$ for every set $A$
	- $\subseteq$ is **antisymmetric**, 
		- because if $A\neq B$, then $A\subseteq B \cap B\subseteq A$ is false
	- $\subseteq$ is **transitive** 
		- because if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subset C$, then $A\subseteq C$ 
- Consequently, $((2^S),\subseteq)$, is a partially ordered set.


in a partially ordered set the notation $a\leq b$ 
- denotes that $(a, b) \in R$ 

*Note :* 
- the symbol $\leq$ is used to denote 
	- the relation in any partially ordered set , 
		- not just the "less than or equal" relation

- The notation $a < b$ denotes that $a \leq b$,
	- but $a \neq b$ 


**Totally Ordered Sets**
For certain applications we require all elements of a set to be comparable 

For example, 
- If we want to write a dictionary, we need to define an order (alphabetic order) on all english words

Definiton : 
- if $(S, \leq)$ is POSET (partially ordered set) 
- and, every two elements of $S$ are comparable
	- $S$ is called a **totally ordered** or **linearly ordered set**
	- and $\leq$ is called a **total order** or **linear order**

Question : 
- Is $(\mathbb{Z}, \leq)$ a totally ordered set?

- Answer :
	- Yes, because $a \leq b$ or $b \leq a$ for all integer $a$ and $b$ 

Question :
- is $(\mathbb{Z}^+, | \ )$ a totally ordered set? (a divides b)

- Answer :
	- No, it contains incomparable elements such as $5$ and $7$


**Equivalence Relation :**
- Equivalence relations are used to relate objects that are similar in some way.

- **Definition :**
	- A relation on set $A$ is called an **equivalence relation**, if it is
		- <u>Reflexive</u>
		- <u>Symmetric</u>
		- <u>and, Transitive</u>
	- <u>two elements</u> that are <u>related by an equivalence relation</u> $R$ 
		- are called **Equivalent**

Example : 
- suppose that $R$ is the relation on
	- the set of strings that consist of English letters 
		- such that $aRb$ if and only if $I(a) = I(b)$ , 
			- where $I(x)$ is the length of the string $x$ 
	- Is $R$ an equivalence relation?

Solution : 
- $R$ is **Reflexive** 
	- because $I(a) = I(a)$ and 
		- therefore $aRa$ for any string a
- $R$ is **Symmetric**
	- Because if $I(a) = I(b)$ then $I(b) = I(a)$
		- so, if $aRb$ then $bRa$ 
- R is **Transitive**
	- because, if $I(a) = I(b)$ and $I(b) = I(c)$ then, $I(a) = I(c)$ 
		- so, $aRb$ and $bRc$ implies $aRc$ 

All three conditions of equivalence relations met, therefore, $R$ is an equivalence relation.

**Equivalence Classes** 
- Definition : Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on set $A$
	- (Reflexive, symmetric and transitve)
		- The <u>set of all elements that are related to an element</u> $a\in A$ is called the **Equivalence Class** of $a$
			- The equivalence class of $a$ with respect to $R$ is denoted by $[a]_R$ 
				- When only one relation is under consideration, 
					- we will delete the subscript $R$ and write $[a]$ for this equivalence class
- if $b\in [a]_R$ 
	- $b$ is the **Representative** of this equivalence class 

Example : 
- In the previous dictionary example (strings of identical length), 
	- what is the equivalence class of the word **mouse**, 
		- denoted by $[\text{mouse}]$ ?

Solution :
- $[\text{mouse}]$  is the set of all english words containing five letters 
	- and 'horse' would be a representative of this equivalence class. 

Theorem : 
Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set $A$. 
The following 3 statements are equivalent: 
- $aRb$
- $[a] = [b]$ 
- $[a] \cap [b] \neq \emptyset$ 
	- Reminder a **Partition** of a set $S$
		- is a collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of $S$ 
			- that have $S$ as their union
				- in other words,
					- the collection of subsets $A_i, \quad i\in I$ 
						- forms a partition of $S$ 
							- if and only if 
								- 1. $A_i \neq \emptyset \quad i \in I$ 
								- 2. $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset, \quad \text{ if } i\neq j$  
								- 3. $\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i = S$    

Theorem : 
Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a set $S$,
- then the equivalence classes of $R$ form a partition of $S$.

- Conversely, given a partition $\{A_i \ | \ i\in I\}$ of the set $S$,
	- there is an equivalence relation $R$ 
		- that has the sets $A_i \quad i\in I$ as its equivalence classes.

Example : 
- live in Boston
	- Frank 
	- Suzanne
	- George

- Live in Lubeck
	- Max
	- Stephanie

- Live in Sydney
	- Jenifer

Let $R$ be the equivalence relation 
- $\{(a, b) \ | \ a \text{ and } b \text{ live in the same city }\}$ 
	- on the set $P = \{\text{ Frank, Suzanne, George, Stephanie, Max, Jennifer }\}$  
- Then 
$$
R = 
\begin{aligned}
&\{\text{(Frank, Frank), (Frank, Suzanne),(Frank,George)},\\
&\text{(Suzanne, Frank), (Suzanne, Suzanne),(Suzanne,George)},\\
&\text{(George, Frank), (George, Suzanne), (George,George)},\\
&\text{(Stephanie, Stephanie), (Stephanie, Max)},\\
&\text{(Max,Stephanie), (Max, Max)},\\
&\text{(Jennifer, Jennifer)}\}
\end{aligned}
$$
Then the equivalence classes of $R$ are the following partition:
$\{\{\text{Frank, Suzanne, George}\}, \{\text{Stephanie, Max}\}, \{\text{ Jennifer }\}\}$ 
The equivalence classes of any equivalence relation $R$ 
- defined on a set $S$ 
	- constitute a partition of $S$
		- because every element in $S$ is assigned to exactly one of the equivalence classes.
