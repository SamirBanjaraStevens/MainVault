As we have seen, scientific theories of dreams are based on the assumption that they occur in our heads, i.e., they are psychological phenomena. At the same time, we have seen some examples, such as among the Mekeo, where people assume that 'dreams' are actually 'events' occurring in an external albeit 'spiritual' space. From a scientific position, dreams are in both cases mental states, images we create, i.e., imaginary. 

However, most of us have had the experience of waking up from a dream and feeling some effects from it, such as fright, joy, uncertainty, etc. In this sense, dreams can have 'real' effects on us. So, even if we think of dreams as a mental state, the state itself is 'real' and so are the effects.

We saw an example of this in the film _Edge of Dreaming_. 

The readings in this section address the 'realness' of dreams. The first sets out the theory on how we can regard our dreams as 'real' in terms of their impact on us. The second is a case study of a woman with anorexia and how her view of her dream as 'real' helped change her life. The third is an autobiographical account of a local Boston man whose dream of Socrates had an impact on his self-understanding.  The fourth is a study of the Asabano of New Guinea and how they distinguish between false and true (real) dreams. 

This session is a chance for us to think of dreams across a number of fields of study and in terms of how they may motivate us to act.
