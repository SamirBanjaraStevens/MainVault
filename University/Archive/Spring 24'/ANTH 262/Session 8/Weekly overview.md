This is a relatively short novel by the science fiction writer Ursula K. LeGuin. She is the daughter of two anthropologists and her works are known to have strong anthropological themes. This story is about a man whose dreams have the power to change external reality. Not all of his dreams have this power; only those he calls 'effective dreams.' Because reality shifts in the story, you have to read somewhat carefully to follow the changes that take place, though the stability of the two main characters helps to orient you throughout.  

I think the first chapter is one key to understanding the novel. Pay close attention to the opening paragraph on the jelly fish and then how it transitions into the apartment of the main character. Something happens between the two stable scenes that has to his eyelids being burned and fallen concrete and then radiation sickness. These themes will come back again later in the story, as will the month of April and the year 1998. 

Beyond this, just read the first six chapters for content and follow the story. I think you will enjoy it.

**Read :** 

- _Dao De Jing/Tao Te_ _Ching_ (short intro)
- _Tao Te Ching_ 1-12 (these are very short chapers)
- _Lathe of Heaven_, Chapters 1-6; Take part in LH Discussion 1

**Due April 18, 11.59 PM**

**Discuss at least three of the following:**

1. What did you think of Chapters 1-12 of the Tao Te Ching? Was there one passage in particular you found interesting or instructive?
2. Note how the novel begins with the jelly fish. Is there an echo of the Tao Te Ching here?
3. Note also the transition from the jellyfish to George Orr - read the passage carefully. What is trapping George physically? How does he get out of it? Is he dreaming of this?
4. At the end of chapter 2, Dr. Haber reacts to Orr's dream and the picture of the horse on his wall. Do you see evidence here that Haber now believes that Orr does have the power he claims to have, i.e., Orr's dreams can change reality? 
5. Discuss some event in Chapters 3-5 that you find interesting, crucial, confusing, Taoist, etc. 
6. In chapter 6, Orr states that he has not right to change the world. Do you agree with him? Or do you agree with Haber that given the dream power that Orr has it is incumbent on him to use it to change things for the better?
7. How does the theme of utopia emerge in the story? Does it begin in a utopian or dustpan future? 
8. What do you think of the characters? 
9. What message or messages do you see emerging from the story?
