1. Do you **understand** the *sleep cycle*? Do you have any questions about it?

### Normal Sleep Patterns :

The sleep cycle can be described as a recurring sequence of sleep stages that include two phases. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) characterized by an active brain but paralyzed body (except for eye movements, middle ear ossicles, and respiration) and NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) where the brain is less active, but the body can move. The cycle begins with NREM sleep, differentiated by EEG characteristics, which is divided into four stages, progressing from light sleep (Stage 1), sleep drowsiness, then to stage 2 and to deep sleep (Stages 3 and 4), known as deep or slow-wave sleep, where brain activity slows down and the body repairs and regenerates tissue.

Following NREM sleep, the cycle moves into REM sleep, characterized by rapid eye movements, increased brain activity, vivid dreams, and temporary muscle paralysis. The first REM period occurs after transitioning through the NREM stages and lasts about 15-20 minutes. A full sleep cycle, from Stage 1 through REM, typically lasts about 90 minutes and repeats several times throughout the night, with REM periods becoming longer towards the morning. This cycle is crucial for physical restoration, brain development, and cognitive functions such as memory consolidation. As the night progresses, Stages 3 and 4 become less apparent, and REM sleep periods grow longer.

### The functios of REM sleep : 

- **Dreams and REM Sleep:** Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep. While the deprivation of REM sleep does not lead to serious psychological disturbances, it results in a REM rebound when normal sleep resumes, suggesting REM sleep's physiological necessity.
- **Sensory System Activation:** During REM sleep, the visual system and limbic system (associated with memories and emotions) are highly activated. This could explain the vividness and emotional intensity of dreams.

2. Did the **reading** that *compared sleep and dreams in rurual Indonesia and the urban US* provide **evidence** that both *sleep and dreaming are shaped by technology and modernity*? How?

1. **Sleep Environments and Practices**: 
- In the urban U.S., the prevalence of technology and modern comforts (e.g., quiet, isolated bedrooms designed specifically for sleeping, the use of beds made comfortable with sheets, blankets, and pillows) contrasts sharply with the more communal and open sleeping arrangements in rural Indonesia. 
- In the U.S., the environment is often controlled to promote uninterrupted sleep, facilitated by technological advancements in home construction, climate control, and bedding. This technological influence shapes expectations and experiences of sleep, emphasizing solitude and uninterrupted rest as the norm.
    
2. **Impact of Electric Lighting and Electronics**: 
- The reading highlighted the influence of electric lighting and electronics on sleep patterns. In the U.S., the use of artificial lighting and screen-based devices before bedtime is common, potentially disrupting natural sleep cycles. 
- In contrast, in rural Indonesia, the absence or limited use of such technology means sleep patterns are more likely to align with natural light-dark cycles, emphasizing the impact of technological advancement on sleep hygiene and circadian rhythms.
    
3. **Cultural Interpretations of Dreams**:
- Technology and modernity also influence cultural interpretations and valuations of dreams. In the urban U.S., where a medicalized and psychological perspective on sleep prevails, dreams might be seen as byproducts of brain activity without significant cultural or spiritual meaning.
- This contrasts with rural Indonesia, where dreams are integrated into cultural and spiritual life, and less influenced by technological perspectives on sleep and dreaming.
    
4. **Modern Lifestyles and Sleep Disorders**: 
- The reading suggested that modern, technologically-driven lifestyles in the U.S. contribute to the medicalization of sleep and the perception of sleep disorders. This includes the use of medication for sleep issues, which reflects a modern approach to managing sleep that is less prevalent in societies like rural Indonesia, where cultural practices and beliefs play a larger role in addressing sleep concerns.

6. Did anything you read relate to or help explain your own sleep/dream experiences?Â 
My father uses a CPAP machine to prevent snoring. This is done to ensure a continious night of sleep. It relates to the broader discussion on how technology and modernity shape our sleep experiences. This is a perfect illustration of the medicalization of sleep in contemporary society, particularly in the context of addressing sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, which the CPAP machine is often prescribed for.
