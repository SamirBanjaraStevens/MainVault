Address both questions:

1. What is the relationship between darkness and the mind in Iceland, and how do dreams figure in this relationship, according to Heijin? 
Heijnen utilizes three primary examples to delineate the connection between darkness and the mind: the folk tale "The Night-Troll," the concept of skyggn, and his fieldwork in Hrunamannahreppur. "The Night-Troll" presents a parallel existence between darkness and the mental realm. Here, darkness is portrayed as the domain where otherworldly beings reside. In the tale, a night troll, an entity of darkness, is transmuted into stone through the recitation of a poem and exposure to sunlight. This story mirrors the belief that darkness conceals entities and realities invisible or absent in light.

Skyggn, on the other hand, refers to individuals endowed with the ability to see in darkness. Described as "people who do not need to rely on dreaming to perceive hidden spheres" (Heijnen, 198), they are characterized as those who "perceive more than others," implying an enhanced awareness and cognition surpassing ordinary sensory experiences. Notably, they are "never afraid of the dark" (Jónasson frá Hrafnagili, 1934:414), indicating that what is veiled in darkness, akin to the nocturnal creatures from the preceding example, is unveiled to them.

In his fieldwork in Hrunamannahreppur, Heijnen observed an interplay between the human world (symbolized by light and day) and concealed spheres allied with night and darkness. One striking observation was a skyggn woman's ability to perceive fylgjur, spiritual companions typically invisible to 'ordinary' individuals. This interaction underscores how darkness in the Icelandic milieu is intertwined with a layer of reality usually concealed or unreachable in light – except for skyggn, who discern these in their waking state.

Heijnen's examples collectively forge a cultural comprehension in Iceland where darkness transcends its physical manifestation, serving as a portal to hidden dimensions, spiritual beings, and alternate realities. These realms are accessible during dreams or at night, except for skyggn individuals. Dreams and heightened perceptual skills (skyggn) act as conduits, enabling humans to access or grasp these obscured facets of the world.
1. How do you think about darkness and the night? What influences your thoughts on these?


Address at least 3 of the following:

1. What is the problem that motivated Adler to write her book on sleep paralysis? 

Adler's motivation for writing her book on sleep paralysis stemmed from her intrigue with unexplained nocturnal deaths, particularly among Hmong immigrants, which paralleled traditional narratives of nocturnal pressing spirit attacks or night-mares. She was struck by the similarity between the symptoms of these sudden deaths and the characteristics of night-mares across different cultures and histories. This observation led her to explore the interconnection between cultural beliefs, biological factors, and sleep paralysis. Her goal was to understand the night-mare phenomenon more comprehensively, considering both its cultural and biological dimensions.

2. Adler chooses to use the word "night-mare" (with hyphen) at certain times; what does this usage signify? How does it differ from the terms "nightmare" and "sleep paralysis"?

The term "night-mare," as Adler uses it, refers to its original meaning, which is a nocturnal visitation by an evil being that physically oppresses and terrifies its victim, leading to a feeling of suffocation. This definition aligns with historical and folkloric interpretations of the night-mare as a spirit or monster. In contemporary sleep research, this experience aligns with what is known as "sleep paralysis," a condition where an individual, during the process of falling asleep or awakening, finds themselves awake yet unable to move or speak, often experiencing a sense of oppressive weight and a feeling of suffocation.

On the other hand, "nightmare" (without the hyphen) in modern usage generally refers to a bad or frightening dream. This kind of nightmare involves waking up from a distressing dream, often with vivid and unpleasant emotional responses, but it does not include the physical sensations of paralysis or suffocation associated with "night-mare."

"Sleep paralysis," as a scientific term, describes a specific sleep disorder where the person experiences temporary immobility during waking or falling asleep, often accompanied by hallucinations and a sense of suffocation. This term is closely related to Adler's use of "night-mare," but it is framed in a clinical context.

Adler uses "night-mare" to specifically denote the more intense, folklore-based experience of a nocturnal evil presence causing physical and psychological distress. This is in contrast to "nightmare," which refers broadly to any disturbing dream, and "sleep paralysis," which is a clinical term for a sleep disorder characterized by temporary immobility and hallucinations.


4. What are the constant features of the "night-mare"? (name at least 4) according to Adler.
   
Being “Awake”:
- Individuals describe their experiences with night-mare attacks, emphasizing that they were fully awake and not dreaming during these episodes. They recount feelings of terror and helplessness, unable to move or speak, despite being conscious of their surroundings. These accounts highlight the intense fear and panic associated with the experience, which cannot be dismissed as just a bad dream, and remain vivid and distressing even after repeated occurrences. The descriptions are sourced from various internet postings, underscoring the real and personal nature of these experiences.
Realistic Perception of Environment:
- Victims recall specific, familiar details of their surroundings, such as a sleeping dog, a partner beside them, or the layout of their bedroom, suggesting they are awake and not dreaming. This clear and realistic perception of normal surroundings during a night-mare adds to the terror, as it confirms they are in a waking state and makes the experience feel undeniably real, eliminating the comfort that it might just be a dream.
Inability to Move:
- Individuals report waking up but being unable to move or breathe, leading to a sense of panic and the fear of death. Some perceive this immobility as being caused by an external force, as they struggle intensely to move or speak. Despite being able to see and be aware of their surroundings, they find themselves completely immobilized, often feeling a tightening grip as they attempt to resist.
Overwhelming Fear and Dread:
- Victims describe an overwhelming sense of evil or horror, often struggling to articulate the severity of their fear. The emotion experienced goes beyond standard fear or terror, with descriptions like a "black horror" or a feeling as if evil is trying to reach their soul. This extreme emotional response, often described using composite terms like "dread/bad/evil," is a significant and disturbing aspect of night-mares, as recounted in various internet postings.


5. How does Adler say that sleep paralysis may help explain witchcraft attacks?
6. Do the similar features of sleep paralysis as well as the specificity of the pandafeche as an entity in Italian experiences of sleep paralysis support the idea of both a universal experience of sleep paralysis as well as the cultural relativity of the experience? 
7.  What do you think of Schegoleva's discussion of Kanishibari in Japan? What does the appearance of Sadako (from the film Ringu) suggest that frighting phenomenon from the waking world does have an impact on dreams and nightmares (Keep in mind that the group in Japan are youth, not adults; and keep in mind the possible transnational features of 'youth culture')? 

You can also speak about the following:

- Did you ever have a nightmare? Have you heard accounts of alien abductions? Tell us about it.
- Comment on anything else you found interesting in the chapters.
