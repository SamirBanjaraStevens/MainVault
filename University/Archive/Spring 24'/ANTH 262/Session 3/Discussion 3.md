#### 1. According to Freud, the sleeping mind disguises dreams. Why does it do this?

According to Freud, the sleeping mind disguises dreams to hide their immoral nature, relating to basic sexual, agressive, and egotistical instincts. This disguise serves two main functions. The mind disguises dreams to prevent powerful, unconscious urges, wishes, and desires from disrupting sleep. These urges are often of a nature that, if recognized directly, could disturb the sleeper's peace and rest. By transforming these urges into a more acceptable, hallucinated form, the mind ensures that sleep continues smoothly. The disguise also allows for a partial, hallucinated fulfillment of those unconscious urges that rise up during sleep. Since many of these urges are considered socially unacceptable or immoral, the censoring agency within the psyche transforms them in such a way that their true nature is hidden. This allows the individual to experience a form of satisfaction without awakening or causing distress.
    
Freud describes the mind's creative process in disguising these urges through mechanisms of dream work, ensuring that the dreams act as "guardians of sleep". This disguise allows the individual to satisfy their unconscious desires in a manner that does not disturb sleep, thus fulfilling both the need for rest and the expression of repressed urges.
#### 2. What is the difference between manifest and latent content, according to Freud?

According to Freud, the difference between manifest and latent content in dreams revolves around what is immediately visible or remembered versus the deeper, underlying meanings and desires.

- **Manifest Content:** This refers to the actual storyline or images of the dream, essentially what we recall upon waking. It's the surface level of the dream, including all the events, characters, and objects that appear in it. This is the dream plot or narrative that we are consciously aware of after we wake up.
    
- **Latent Content:** Beneath the surface of the manifest content lies the latent content, which Freud believed represents our deepest, often unacknowledged, desires and thoughts. These underlying wishes are expressions of our fundamental sexual, aggressive, and egotistical instincts. The latent content is not immediately obvious because it's often considered immoral or antisocial, so our mind disguises it through symbols within the dream. It's the hidden meaning behind the symbols presented in the dream, revealing our subconscious wishes and desires.
#### 3. What is the biological function of dreams, according to Freud? How else can they function? Be sure to specify, if you can, the biological function from how they may function in therapy.


When we fall asleep, a conflict arises between two different desire. The need for rest, that peaceful sleep bring us; on the other hadn. Carious unconcioue urges take advantage of the weakened poer of consciouness in sleep to asseert them self. But the urges are imoral, threating to disturb sleep. Thus, in order to accomidate sleep and wish to satisfy unconcious urges, the mind,'psychic apparatus', generates dreams.

According to Freud, the biological function of dreams serves two primary purposes:

1. **To Protect Peaceful Sleep:** Freud posited that dreams play a crucial role in protecting sleep. By creating a narrative or hallucinated fulfillment of repressed desires, dreams allow the psychic apparatus to rest peacefully without being disturbed by these underlying urges. This function ensures that sleep is not interrupted by the individual's unconscious desires and conflicts, thereby serving a protective role that enables rest and recuperation.
2. **To Provide Partial Fulfillment of Unconscious Urges:** Dreams also serve the function of providing a hallucinated satisfaction of powerful unconscious urges, wishes, and desires that arise during sleep. Freud believed that every dream represents the fulfillment of a wish on the part of the dreamer, which could be a desire repressed in waking life or one that could not be expressed for some reason. This aspect of dream function allows for the safe expression and partial satisfaction of these repressed desires in a manner that does not disturb the individual's sleep or mental equilibrium.
#### 4. According to Adler, what is the psychoanalytical theory of the cause of nightmares? Adler criticizes this theory. Why? Do you agree with her?

Psychoanalytical theory, as Ernest Jones interprets it, suggests that nightmares are mainly caused by hidden sexual conflicts. Jones describes nightmares in a classic way, involving intense fear, feeling crushed or heavy on the chest, and being unable to move, without considering the fact that people are partly awake during these experiences. Instead, he thinks of these symptoms as happening in a disturbing dream because he doesn't recognize they happen in a semi-awake state. This idea comes from a broader belief, shared with Freud, that all dreams (mistakenly including nightmares) come from our deepest, unspoken thoughts, especially about sexual issues. Jones thought of nightmares as "fear attacks" coming from deep conflicts about suppressed sexual desires, often about taboo subjects like incest.

Adler criticizes this theory for several reasons. Firstly, she points out that by not acknowledging the unique state of waking consciousness in which the night-mare occurs, Jones contributed to the long-standing scientific confusion over the significant differences between night-mares and "bad dreams." This oversight also meant losing the opportunity to benefit from the firsthand knowledge of night-mare sufferers. Additionally, Adler likely critiques the theory for its narrow focus on sexual conflicts as the sole cause of nightmares, ignoring other potential psychological, cultural, and physiological factors that modern sleep research has since identified.

I find Adler's criticism valid. Saying that nightmares are only about hidden sexual desires oversimplifies the real causes. Today's research shows nightmares can come from many different sources, including everyday stress and traumatic events, not just sexual issues. Also, sleep paralysis, often mixed up with nightmares in these theories, has physical and brain-related explanations that psychoanalytical theory doesn't cover. Adler suggests we should look at nightmares and sleep paralysis more broadly, considering many more factors than just psychoanalytical ones.


#### 5. How do dreams provide otherwise 'hidden knowledge' for the Mekeo? In other words, in their understanding, how might a person come to gain insight into themselves?


###### Unveiling the Hidden Self Through Dreaming
For the Mekeo, the act of dreaming serves as a window into a deeply concealed facet of the self, a facet that is only accessible through the distorted and symbolic language of dreams. This hidden self's actions, desires, and perceptions manifest vividly in dreamscapes, providing a reflective mirror of its doings in the ethereal dream world.

###### The Symbolism of Dreams
The imagery within these dreams is not arbitrary; it is thought to symbolize actual occurrences within the dream realm. When interpreting the significance of a dream, the Mekeo consider not only the imagery but also the real-life context of the dreamerâ€”encompassing the immediate circumstances of waking life, personal life experiences, and events that follow the dream.


###### Emotional Expression and Communication
Celestina's experiences with dreaming illuminate how an attentive engagement with one's dreams, and the behaviors of the concealed self within them, grants the conscious mind a medium to express emotions that are typically suppressed or unacknowledged. This process facilitates a method of emotional communication that sidesteps direct confrontation or self-incrimination, thereby nurturing a deeper understanding and awareness of one's desires and needs that lie beyond the realm of conscious thought.

###### Interpersonal Dynamics in Dreaming
Moreover, the interaction with the hidden self extends beyond the individual's own dreams. It manifests in the dreams of others, where its actions hold as much significance as they do within one's personal dream narratives. When others dream of one's hidden self engaging in erotic or hostile behaviors, it signals an underlying reality about one's unspoken motives and desires.

###### Cultural Interpretation and Insight
To glean insight from these nocturnal visions, some Mekeo turn to their cultural traditions of dream interpretation. This practice allows them to decode the profound meanings embedded in their dreams, thereby achieving a greater understanding of themselves. Through this lens, dreams become a potent tool for self-discovery, offering glimpses into the depths of the psyche that remain otherwise obscured in daily life.



#### 6. Is the Mekeo 'hidden self' the same as what Freud and most of us all the unconscious, i.e., a part of ourselves that is often hidden from us but which we sometimes come to know or understand?


Here are some ways in which they are similar:

1. **Influence of Unseen Processes:** Both concepts acknowledge that there are parts of the self that operate outside of conscious awareness. These hidden or unconscious processes can significantly impact an individual's actions, feelings, and decisions without their explicit knowledge.
2. **Containment of Repressed Elements:** Freud's unconscious includes instincts, wishes, memories, and mental processes that are repressed or denied access to the conscious mind due to their perceived immorality, often relating to basic sexual, aggressive, and egotistical instincts. Similarly, the Mekeo's "hidden self" may encompass aspects of the self that are not consciously acknowledged due to cultural, social, or personal reasons.
3. **Potential for Becoming Known:** Both Freud's and the Mekeo's concepts suggest that while aspects of the "hidden self" or unconscious are initially beyond our awareness, they can sometimes be made known or understood through certain processes (such as psychoanalysis in Freud's theory or through cultural practices and introspection in the Mekeo context).

Freud's "hidden self" is essentially the unconscious part of the mind, comprising instincts, wishes, memories, and mental processes that have been repressed or denied access to the conscious and preconscious systems because they are considered immoral. This immorality stems from basic sexual, aggressive, and egotistical instincts. Freud sees the **core of our being** as consisting of unconscious wishful impulses or primary thought processes that are instinctual, wishful, irrational, and driven by the pleasure principle.

The Mekeo's idea of the "hidden self" and Freud's concept of the unconscious both deal with parts of ourselves that we're not fully aware of yet still affect how we think and act. However, the Mekeo perspective might diverge from Freud's theories due to the unique cultural lens through which the Mekeo view these unseen aspects of the self. In Mekeo culture, different values, beliefs, and interpretations could define the "hidden self" in ways that vary from the psychoanalytic interpretation by Freud.
