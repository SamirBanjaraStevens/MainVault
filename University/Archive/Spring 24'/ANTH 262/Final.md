Session 1: 
There is one point I want to repeat at the outset, and that is to be careful in thinking too much in terms of a dichotomy between "western" and "non-western" in the cross- cultural understanding of dreams. Some of our texts will do this, but I am of the view that the western/non-western distinction is largely invalid and typically misstated. If we use the term "western" we should do so not as a cultural distinction but technological one.  "Western" is best understood as meaning "industrial," "technological," and "scientific." On these grounds most of the world is "western" given that most of world is industrialized, enmeshed in electrical and digital technology, and uses the scientific method. There are certainly pockets of people who remain largely untouched by these developments, but they are fewer and fewer. A related point here is to avoid thinking that pre-western or tribal societies always had rich and complex dream lives. Many certainly did - but some did not. And there are complex dream traditions that emerged in the industrial world of Europe, such as those of Carl Jung.

- "Sleepless in Japan - Kanashibari Paralysis"
Address both questions:

1. What is the relationship between darkness and the mind in Iceland, and how do dreams figure in this relationship, according to Heijin? 
Heijnen utilizes three primary examples to delineate the connection between darkness and the mind: the folk tale "The Night-Troll," the concept of skyggn, and his fieldwork in Hrunamannahreppur. "The Night-Troll" presents a parallel existence between darkness and the mental realm. Here, darkness is portrayed as the domain where otherworldly beings reside. In the tale, a night troll, an entity of darkness, is transmuted into stone through the recitation of a poem and exposure to sunlight. This story mirrors the belief that darkness conceals entities and realities invisible or absent in light.

Skyggn, on the other hand, refers to individuals endowed with the ability to see in darkness. Described as "people who do not need to rely on dreaming to perceive hidden spheres" (Heijnen, 198), they are characterized as those who "perceive more than others," implying an enhanced awareness and cognition surpassing ordinary sensory experiences. Notably, they are "never afraid of the dark" (Jónasson frá Hrafnagili, 1934:414), indicating that what is veiled in darkness, akin to the nocturnal creatures from the preceding example, is unveiled to them.

In his fieldwork in Hrunamannahreppur, Heijnen observed an interplay between the human world (symbolized by light and day) and concealed spheres allied with night and darkness. One striking observation was a skyggn woman's ability to perceive fylgjur, spiritual companions typically invisible to 'ordinary' individuals. This interaction underscores how darkness in the Icelandic milieu is intertwined with a layer of reality usually concealed or unreachable in light – except for skyggn, who discern these in their waking state.

Heijnen's examples collectively forge a cultural comprehension in Iceland where darkness transcends its physical manifestation, serving as a portal to hidden dimensions, spiritual beings, and alternate realities. These realms are accessible during dreams or at night, except for skyggn individuals. Dreams and heightened perceptual skills (skyggn) act as conduits, enabling humans to access or grasp these obscured facets of the world.
1. How do you think about darkness and the night? What influences your thoughts on these?


Address at least 3 of the following:

1. What is the problem that motivated Adler to write her book on sleep paralysis? 

Adler's motivation for writing her book on sleep paralysis stemmed from her intrigue with unexplained nocturnal deaths, particularly among Hmong immigrants, which paralleled traditional narratives of nocturnal pressing spirit attacks or night-mares. She was struck by the similarity between the symptoms of these sudden deaths and the characteristics of night-mares across different cultures and histories. This observation led her to explore the interconnection between cultural beliefs, biological factors, and sleep paralysis. Her goal was to understand the night-mare phenomenon more comprehensively, considering both its cultural and biological dimensions.

2. Adler chooses to use the word "night-mare" (with hyphen) at certain times; what does this usage signify? How does it differ from the terms "nightmare" and "sleep paralysis"?

The term "night-mare," as Adler uses it, refers to its original meaning, which is a nocturnal visitation by an evil being that physically oppresses and terrifies its victim, leading to a feeling of suffocation. This definition aligns with historical and folkloric interpretations of the night-mare as a spirit or monster. In contemporary sleep research, this experience aligns with what is known as "sleep paralysis," a condition where an individual, during the process of falling asleep or awakening, finds themselves awake yet unable to move or speak, often experiencing a sense of oppressive weight and a feeling of suffocation.

On the other hand, "nightmare" (without the hyphen) in modern usage generally refers to a bad or frightening dream. This kind of nightmare involves waking up from a distressing dream, often with vivid and unpleasant emotional responses, but it does not include the physical sensations of paralysis or suffocation associated with "night-mare."

"Sleep paralysis," as a scientific term, describes a specific sleep disorder where the person experiences temporary immobility during waking or falling asleep, often accompanied by hallucinations and a sense of suffocation. This term is closely related to Adler's use of "night-mare," but it is framed in a clinical context.

Adler uses "night-mare" to specifically denote the more intense, folklore-based experience of a nocturnal evil presence causing physical and psychological distress. This is in contrast to "nightmare," which refers broadly to any disturbing dream, and "sleep paralysis," which is a clinical term for a sleep disorder characterized by temporary immobility and hallucinations.


4. What are the constant features of the "night-mare"? (name at least 4) according to Adler.
   
Being “Awake”:
- Individuals describe their experiences with night-mare attacks, emphasizing that they were fully awake and not dreaming during these episodes. They recount feelings of terror and helplessness, unable to move or speak, despite being conscious of their surroundings. These accounts highlight the intense fear and panic associated with the experience, which cannot be dismissed as just a bad dream, and remain vivid and distressing even after repeated occurrences. The descriptions are sourced from various internet postings, underscoring the real and personal nature of these experiences.
Realistic Perception of Environment:
- Victims recall specific, familiar details of their surroundings, such as a sleeping dog, a partner beside them, or the layout of their bedroom, suggesting they are awake and not dreaming. This clear and realistic perception of normal surroundings during a night-mare adds to the terror, as it confirms they are in a waking state and makes the experience feel undeniably real, eliminating the comfort that it might just be a dream.
Inability to Move:
- Individuals report waking up but being unable to move or breathe, leading to a sense of panic and the fear of death. Some perceive this immobility as being caused by an external force, as they struggle intensely to move or speak. Despite being able to see and be aware of their surroundings, they find themselves completely immobilized, often feeling a tightening grip as they attempt to resist.
Overwhelming Fear and Dread:
- Victims describe an overwhelming sense of evil or horror, often struggling to articulate the severity of their fear. The emotion experienced goes beyond standard fear or terror, with descriptions like a "black horror" or a feeling as if evil is trying to reach their soul. This extreme emotional response, often described using composite terms like "dread/bad/evil," is a significant and disturbing aspect of night-mares, as recounted in various internet postings.

Take Part in Discussion 3

1. Do you **understand** the *sleep cycle*? Do you have any questions about it?

### Normal Sleep Patterns :

The sleep cycle can be described as a recurring sequence of sleep stages that include two phases. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) characterized by an active brain but paralyzed body (except for eye movements, middle ear ossicles, and respiration) and NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) where the brain is less active, but the body can move. The cycle begins with NREM sleep, differentiated by EEG characteristics, which is divided into four stages, progressing from light sleep (Stage 1), sleep drowsiness, then to stage 2 and to deep sleep (Stages 3 and 4), known as deep or slow-wave sleep, where brain activity slows down and the body repairs and regenerates tissue.

Following NREM sleep, the cycle moves into REM sleep, characterized by rapid eye movements, increased brain activity, vivid dreams, and temporary muscle paralysis. The first REM period occurs after transitioning through the NREM stages and lasts about 15-20 minutes. A full sleep cycle, from Stage 1 through REM, typically lasts about 90 minutes and repeats several times throughout the night, with REM periods becoming longer towards the morning. This cycle is crucial for physical restoration, brain development, and cognitive functions such as memory consolidation. As the night progresses, Stages 3 and 4 become less apparent, and REM sleep periods grow longer.

### The functios of REM sleep : 

- **Dreams and REM Sleep:** Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep. While the deprivation of REM sleep does not lead to serious psychological disturbances, it results in a REM rebound when normal sleep resumes, suggesting REM sleep's physiological necessity.
- **Sensory System Activation:** During REM sleep, the visual system and limbic system (associated with memories and emotions) are highly activated. This could explain the vividness and emotional intensity of dreams.

2. Did the **reading** that *compared sleep and dreams in rurual Indonesia and the urban US* provide **evidence** that both *sleep and dreaming are shaped by technology and modernity*? How?

1. **Sleep Environments and Practices**: 
- In the urban U.S., the prevalence of technology and modern comforts (e.g., quiet, isolated bedrooms designed specifically for sleeping, the use of beds made comfortable with sheets, blankets, and pillows) contrasts sharply with the more communal and open sleeping arrangements in rural Indonesia. 
- In the U.S., the environment is often controlled to promote uninterrupted sleep, facilitated by technological advancements in home construction, climate control, and bedding. This technological influence shapes expectations and experiences of sleep, emphasizing solitude and uninterrupted rest as the norm.
    
2. **Impact of Electric Lighting and Electronics**: 
- The reading highlighted the influence of electric lighting and electronics on sleep patterns. In the U.S., the use of artificial lighting and screen-based devices before bedtime is common, potentially disrupting natural sleep cycles. 
- In contrast, in rural Indonesia, the absence or limited use of such technology means sleep patterns are more likely to align with natural light-dark cycles, emphasizing the impact of technological advancement on sleep hygiene and circadian rhythms.
    
3. **Cultural Interpretations of Dreams**:
- Technology and modernity also influence cultural interpretations and valuations of dreams. In the urban U.S., where a medicalized and psychological perspective on sleep prevails, dreams might be seen as byproducts of brain activity without significant cultural or spiritual meaning.
- This contrasts with rural Indonesia, where dreams are integrated into cultural and spiritual life, and less influenced by technological perspectives on sleep and dreaming.
    
4. **Modern Lifestyles and Sleep Disorders**: 
- The reading suggested that modern, technologically-driven lifestyles in the U.S. contribute to the medicalization of sleep and the perception of sleep disorders. This includes the use of medication for sleep issues, which reflects a modern approach to managing sleep that is less prevalent in societies like rural Indonesia, where cultural practices and beliefs play a larger role in addressing sleep concerns.

6. Did anything you read relate to or help explain your own sleep/dream experiences? 
My father uses a CPAP machine to prevent snoring. This is done to ensure a continious night of sleep. It relates to the broader discussion on how technology and modernity shape our sleep experiences. This is a perfect illustration of the medicalization of sleep in contemporary society, particularly in the context of addressing sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, which the CPAP machine is often prescribed for.

Take part in Discussion 5

### 1. According to Freud, the sleeping mind disguises dreams. Why does it do this?

According to Freud, the sleeping mind disguises dreams to hide their immoral nature, relating to basic sexual, agressive, and egotistical instincts. This disguise serves two main functions. The mind disguises dreams to prevent powerful, unconscious urges, wishes, and desires from disrupting sleep. These urges are often of a nature that, if recognized directly, could disturb the sleeper's peace and rest. By transforming these urges into a more acceptable, hallucinated form, the mind ensures that sleep continues smoothly. The disguise also allows for a partial, hallucinated fulfillment of those unconscious urges that rise up during sleep. Since many of these urges are considered socially unacceptable or immoral, the censoring agency within the psyche transforms them in such a way that their true nature is hidden. This allows the individual to experience a form of satisfaction without awakening or causing distress.
    
Freud describes the mind's creative process in disguising these urges through mechanisms of dream work, ensuring that the dreams act as "guardians of sleep". This disguise allows the individual to satisfy their unconscious desires in a manner that does not disturb sleep, thus fulfilling both the need for rest and the expression of repressed urges.
#### 2. What is the difference between manifest and latent content, according to Freud?

According to Freud, the difference between manifest and latent content in dreams revolves around what is immediately visible or remembered versus the deeper, underlying meanings and desires.

- **Manifest Content:** This refers to the actual storyline or images of the dream, essentially what we recall upon waking. It's the surface level of the dream, including all the events, characters, and objects that appear in it. This is the dream plot or narrative that we are consciously aware of after we wake up.
    
- **Latent Content:** Beneath the surface of the manifest content lies the latent content, which Freud believed represents our deepest, often unacknowledged, desires and thoughts. These underlying wishes are expressions of our fundamental sexual, aggressive, and egotistical instincts. The latent content is not immediately obvious because it's often considered immoral or antisocial, so our mind disguises it through symbols within the dream. It's the hidden meaning behind the symbols presented in the dream, revealing our subconscious wishes and desires.
#### 3. What is the biological function of dreams, according to Freud? How else can they function? Be sure to specify, if you can, the biological function from how they may function in therapy.


When we fall asleep, a conflict arises between two different desire. The need for rest, that peaceful sleep bring us; on the other hadn. Carious unconcioue urges take advantage of the weakened poer of consciouness in sleep to asseert them self. But the urges are imoral, threating to disturb sleep. Thus, in order to accomidate sleep and wish to satisfy unconcious urges, the mind,'psychic apparatus', generates dreams.

According to Freud, the biological function of dreams serves two primary purposes:

1. **To Protect Peaceful Sleep:** Freud posited that dreams play a crucial role in protecting sleep. By creating a narrative or hallucinated fulfillment of repressed desires, dreams allow the psychic apparatus to rest peacefully without being disturbed by these underlying urges. This function ensures that sleep is not interrupted by the individual's unconscious desires and conflicts, thereby serving a protective role that enables rest and recuperation.
2. **To Provide Partial Fulfillment of Unconscious Urges:** Dreams also serve the function of providing a hallucinated satisfaction of powerful unconscious urges, wishes, and desires that arise during sleep. Freud believed that every dream represents the fulfillment of a wish on the part of the dreamer, which could be a desire repressed in waking life or one that could not be expressed for some reason. This aspect of dream function allows for the safe expression and partial satisfaction of these repressed desires in a manner that does not disturb the individual's sleep or mental equilibrium.
#### 4. According to Adler, what is the psychoanalytical theory of the cause of nightmares? Adler criticizes this theory. Why? Do you agree with her?

Psychoanalytical theory, as Ernest Jones interprets it, suggests that nightmares are mainly caused by hidden sexual conflicts. Jones describes nightmares in a classic way, involving intense fear, feeling crushed or heavy on the chest, and being unable to move, without considering the fact that people are partly awake during these experiences. Instead, he thinks of these symptoms as happening in a disturbing dream because he doesn't recognize they happen in a semi-awake state. This idea comes from a broader belief, shared with Freud, that all dreams (mistakenly including nightmares) come from our deepest, unspoken thoughts, especially about sexual issues. Jones thought of nightmares as "fear attacks" coming from deep conflicts about suppressed sexual desires, often about taboo subjects like incest.

Adler criticizes this theory for several reasons. Firstly, she points out that by not acknowledging the unique state of waking consciousness in which the night-mare occurs, Jones contributed to the long-standing scientific confusion over the significant differences between night-mares and "bad dreams." This oversight also meant losing the opportunity to benefit from the firsthand knowledge of night-mare sufferers. Additionally, Adler likely critiques the theory for its narrow focus on sexual conflicts as the sole cause of nightmares, ignoring other potential psychological, cultural, and physiological factors that modern sleep research has since identified.

I find Adler's criticism valid. Saying that nightmares are only about hidden sexual desires oversimplifies the real causes. Today's research shows nightmares can come from many different sources, including everyday stress and traumatic events, not just sexual issues. Also, sleep paralysis, often mixed up with nightmares in these theories, has physical and brain-related explanations that psychoanalytical theory doesn't cover. Adler suggests we should look at nightmares and sleep paralysis more broadly, considering many more factors than just psychoanalytical ones.


#### 5. How do dreams provide otherwise 'hidden knowledge' for the Mekeo? In other words, in their understanding, how might a person come to gain insight into themselves?


###### Unveiling the Hidden Self Through Dreaming
For the Mekeo, the act of dreaming serves as a window into a deeply concealed facet of the self, a facet that is only accessible through the distorted and symbolic language of dreams. This hidden self's actions, desires, and perceptions manifest vividly in dreamscapes, providing a reflective mirror of its doings in the ethereal dream world.

###### The Symbolism of Dreams
The imagery within these dreams is not arbitrary; it is thought to symbolize actual occurrences within the dream realm. When interpreting the significance of a dream, the Mekeo consider not only the imagery but also the real-life context of the dreamer—encompassing the immediate circumstances of waking life, personal life experiences, and events that follow the dream.


###### Emotional Expression and Communication
Celestina's experiences with dreaming illuminate how an attentive engagement with one's dreams, and the behaviors of the concealed self within them, grants the conscious mind a medium to express emotions that are typically suppressed or unacknowledged. This process facilitates a method of emotional communication that sidesteps direct confrontation or self-incrimination, thereby nurturing a deeper understanding and awareness of one's desires and needs that lie beyond the realm of conscious thought.

###### Interpersonal Dynamics in Dreaming
Moreover, the interaction with the hidden self extends beyond the individual's own dreams. It manifests in the dreams of others, where its actions hold as much significance as they do within one's personal dream narratives. When others dream of one's hidden self engaging in erotic or hostile behaviors, it signals an underlying reality about one's unspoken motives and desires.

###### Cultural Interpretation and Insight
To glean insight from these nocturnal visions, some Mekeo turn to their cultural traditions of dream interpretation. This practice allows them to decode the profound meanings embedded in their dreams, thereby achieving a greater understanding of themselves. Through this lens, dreams become a potent tool for self-discovery, offering glimpses into the depths of the psyche that remain otherwise obscured in daily life.



#### 6. Is the Mekeo 'hidden self' the same as what Freud and most of us all the unconscious, i.e., a part of ourselves that is often hidden from us but which we sometimes come to know or understand?


Here are some ways in which they are similar:

1. **Influence of Unseen Processes:** Both concepts acknowledge that there are parts of the self that operate outside of conscious awareness. These hidden or unconscious processes can significantly impact an individual's actions, feelings, and decisions without their explicit knowledge.
2. **Containment of Repressed Elements:** Freud's unconscious includes instincts, wishes, memories, and mental processes that are repressed or denied access to the conscious mind due to their perceived immorality, often relating to basic sexual, aggressive, and egotistical instincts. Similarly, the Mekeo's "hidden self" may encompass aspects of the self that are not consciously acknowledged due to cultural, social, or personal reasons.
3. **Potential for Becoming Known:** Both Freud's and the Mekeo's concepts suggest that while aspects of the "hidden self" or unconscious are initially beyond our awareness, they can sometimes be made known or understood through certain processes (such as psychoanalysis in Freud's theory or through cultural practices and introspection in the Mekeo context).

Freud's "hidden self" is essentially the unconscious part of the mind, comprising instincts, wishes, memories, and mental processes that have been repressed or denied access to the conscious and preconscious systems because they are considered immoral. This immorality stems from basic sexual, aggressive, and egotistical instincts. Freud sees the **core of our being** as consisting of unconscious wishful impulses or primary thought processes that are instinctual, wishful, irrational, and driven by the pleasure principle.

The Mekeo's idea of the "hidden self" and Freud's concept of the unconscious both deal with parts of ourselves that we're not fully aware of yet still affect how we think and act. However, the Mekeo perspective might diverge from Freud's theories due to the unique cultural lens through which the Mekeo view these unseen aspects of the self. In Mekeo culture, different values, beliefs, and interpretations could define the "hidden self" in ways that vary from the psychoanalytic interpretation by Freud.

# session 4
The section is designed to expose you to some interesting material on dreams and healing. It is a longer session with three parts or phases. The focus of all parts is healing in dreams. The first two cover a controversy over the dream practices of the Senoi people (also called Semai, Temai, and Orang Asli).

- In Part I, you will read an article by anthropologist Kilton Stewart who stated that Senoi dream theory/practices were central to the healthy and peaceful lifestyle of the Senoi, and an article by Johnstone who suggests how these Senoi practices could be applied in industrial society. 
- In Part II, you will read a critique of Stewart and the application of Senoi dream practices by G. William Domhoff. 
- In Part II, you will watch a film in which a woman found some healing in her dreams, and also read some articles on healing in and with dreams.

PArt one discussion

Please post your thoughts on the two articles you read, one by Stewart and the other by Johnstone. Just share your thoughts, reactions, etc. No need to respond to others, though you may do so of course if you please.

In my reading of "The Elements of Senoi Dreaming," one comment particularly resonated with me:

"I have found it very helpful for both the leader and the dreamer to regard the dreamer as reporting a current experience from another plane of consciousness." (p. 53)

This insightful observation was highlighted in the section on Embellishment, which begins with the leader asking, "What is happening right now?" This prompts the dreamer to re-experience the dream with closed eye, suggesting they are navigating their dream using the _key_ through a different dimension of consciousness.

I wholeheartedly agree with the author's perspective that this phenomenon occurs on an alternate plane of consciousness. I propose referring to this state as "Active Imagination," a term I believe encompasses the entirety of the Senoi dreamwork experience. In my view, Active Imagination is a form of inner dialogue with various aspects of the self residing in the unconscious. Unlike dreaming, where one is detached from conscious awareness, Active Imagination involves a fully awake and conscious state, aligning with the expectations placed on the dreamer in the Senoi dreamwork process.

[COLLAPSE](https://umb.umassonline.net/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_65981_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_108078_1&forum_id=_244395_1&message_id=_3022523_1#)

Domhoff criticizes Stewart's theory about the Senoi tribe's dream practices, pointing out several key issues:

1. **Real Anthropological Research:** Domhoff highlights work by anthropologists like Robert Dentan, Geoffrey Benjamin, and Clayton Robarchek who actually lived with the Senoi, learned their language, and got to know their culture deeply. This provides a solid empirical foundation for Domhoff's arguments. They found that the Senoi don't follow the dream practices Stewart described. This is important because these anthropologists got their information from long experiences, greater then 4 months unlike Stewart.
    
2. **Stewart's Misinterpretation:** Stewart's idea of Senoi dream practices was more a product of his imagination than real understanding. He visited the Senoi briefly and didn't have the anthropological background, leading him to misinterpret their culture.
    
3. **No Proof for Dream Control:** Domhoff also points out that there's no real proof for Stewart's claims that the Senoi used dream control for mental health, peace, and creativity. This is a big deal because Stewart made it sound like these practices were a major part of Senoi life. The Senoi did indeed practice some sort of dream talk, where the children would tell their dreams in the mornings at the familt breakfast.
    
4. **Inconsistencies in Accounts:** There are problems with the stories told by Stewart and later Patricia Garfield, who also didn't spend much time with the Senoi but made broad statements about their culture and dreams.
    

Domhoff argues that Stewart's theory on Senoi dream practices doesn't hold up when you look at the actual evidence.

This debate teaches us to be careful about how we interpret and represent other cultures, especially in psychology and dream studies.

It shows the importance of doing thorough research, being skeptical of claims, and understanding the context before making conclusions about cultural practices.

Hi Samir, I think I may have understood the instructions and read far more of Domhoff's paper than required! But in Chapter 2 he actually explains that there is no such thing as family breakfast among the Senoi- most members wake up at different times, and few eat breakfast to begin with. That part stuck out to me particularly, because that goes beyond any possible misinterpretation and makes it clear Stewart was just directly making some things up. You make a good point about Stewart and Garfield not spending nearly enough time amongst the Senoi to accurately experience and report on their culture though!

Part III discussion
Address any of the following and comment on the post of a classmate. 

1. What is the significance of the film’s title?
2. What did you learn from this film? What insights did it provide?
3. If you could ask the filmmaker a question, what would you ask and why?
4. Describe a moment or scene in the film that you found particularly disturbing or moving. What was it about that scene that was especially compelling for you?
5. Do you think some kind of healing with dreams is possible? Does the film provide evidence for this? Do the Hargood and Heyan articles suggest anything?

The title "Edge of Dreaming" can be discussed profoundly, especially when considered through the lens of Carl Jung's concept of active imagination. Jung's theory posits that engaging with the unconscious through active imagination can lead to profound psychological insights and personal transformation.

By documenting her experiences, fears, and the subsequent quest for understanding, Hardie engages in a form of active imagination, using the film as a medium to bridge her inner world with the external reality. The act of filmmaking itself, in Hardie's case, becomes a therapeutic process, a way to actively engage with her dreams and fears. By visualizing and narrating her inner experiences, she not only confronts her unconscious premonitions but also transforms them. 

Thus, I am interpreting the meaning of the title "Edge of Dreaming" as Hardie interpertation or practice of  Jung's "active imagination". Highlighted by the film's exploration of the transformative power of engaging with the unconscious.

# Session 6

As we have seen, scientific theories of dreams are based on the assumption that they occur in our heads, i.e., they are psychological phenomena. At the same time, we have seen some examples, such as among the Mekeo, where people assume that 'dreams' are actually 'events' occurring in an external albeit 'spiritual' space. From a scientific position, dreams are in both cases mental states, images we create, i.e., imaginary. 

However, most of us have had the experience of waking up from a dream and feeling some effects from it, such as fright, joy, uncertainty, etc. In this sense, dreams can have 'real' effects on us. So, even if we think of dreams as a mental state, the state itself is 'real' and so are the effects.

We saw an example of this in the film _Edge of Dreaming_. 

The readings in this section address the 'realness' of dreams. The first sets out the theory on how we can regard our dreams as 'real' in terms of their impact on us. The second is a case study of a woman with anorexia and how her view of her dream as 'real' helped change her life. The third is an autobiographical account of a local Boston man whose dream of Socrates had an impact on his self-understanding.  The fourth is a study of the Asabano of New Guinea and how they distinguish between false and true (real) dreams. 

This session is a chance for us to think of dreams across a number of fields of study and in terms of how they may motivate us to act.

Read the following:

1. Craig, "Realness of Dreams" (and "Outline of Craig Reading")
2. Knudson, "Anorexia and Dreaming"
3. Indrisano, "My Dream of Socrates"
4. "Dreaming and Reality - A Neuroanthropological Account"

- Optional: Dostoevsky, "Dream of a Ridiculous Man" (Craig refers to this story in his article, so I placed it here for those who are interested). 
- Optional: "Central Images Makes the Big Dream 'Big'"
- Optional: "Significant Dreams - Bizarre of Big?"
What do you think of the idea of treating our dreams as 'real?' How did any of the readings speak to this idea? Remember that by 'realness' we mean that dreams have real physiological and psychological effects on us; that they reflect waking concerns; and that they can impact the way we act in the world upon awakening. Not all dreams do this, but some do, especially 'big dreams.' How does this idea impact how you understand your own dreams? Please add any other thoughts or questions you have and try to respond to another post to create a discussion. Here are some other things to address:

1. Discuss the difference between Stephanie's understanding of her dream and that of her therapist. How did Stephanie treat her dream as 'real?'
2. How was Ralph's dream of Socrates real to him? What aspects of his reality did it reflect. Consider here how Socrates might reflect the MIT Professor and how Ralph's desire for education rubbed up against the values of many in the North End at that time and in what ways the dream might help him deal with that. 
3. Remembering that we are understanding the word "Western" as synonymous with a globalized industrial liberally ordered society that includes counties like Japan, South Korea, China, and countries in the middle east, Africa, and elsewhere, which means that contrary to what Laughlin says in "Dreaming and Reality," most people do not regard dreams as actual encounters with dream beings, does the approach of Craig to realness help take our dreams as a sources of knowledge in the way some traditional groups did and still do?

While dreams themselves are mental experiences disconnected from physical reality, the readings highlight how these inner experiences can profoundly shape our real emotions, thought patterns, and behaviors.

  

##### Insights From Readings

###### Dostoevsky:

Interestingly, Dostoevsky juxtaposes the scientific pursuit and the emergence of suffering, suggesting a universe where truth and understanding flourish without the necessity of pain—a stark contrast to the world we inhabit, shaped by evolution through natural selection, where beauty stems from struggle and suffering. Entire species have died for the salvation of man, the death of the Neanderthals for the sake of Homo Spaiens. Moreover, Dostoevsky's critique of the intellect's arrogance and his appeal for a heart-led approach to existence reiterates the timeless message that humanity's salvation lies in empathy, love, and mercy. 

  

###### Craig:

Imagine stepping through a portal, where the boundaries between the conscious and unconscious realms blur. Dreams beckon us, not as mere nocturnal reveries but as enigmatic voyages that possess the remarkable ability to sculpt our very perception of the tangible world. This alluring proposition invites us to ponder: what if dreams are not merely mirrors of our innermost selves but parallel dimensions, as vivid and palpable as the waking reality we navigate?

The Craig reading lays out a conceptual framework and makes a compelling case that dreams should be considered 'real' phenomena worthy of analysis, given their ability to induce powerful feelings, tap into our deepest desires/fears, and potentially motivate life changes upon waking. The example of post-traumatic nightmares vividly illustrates how dreams directly arise from real experiences and have very real emotional aftereffects. Even mundane dreams can expose our subconscious preoccupations.  
  

Craig's perspective provides a means of reconciling the views of modern industrialized societies with those of traditional cultures that see dreams as significant interactions with the spiritual or profound realms. By positioning dreams as wellsprings of knowledge and self-insight, Craig prompts a reconsideration of the capacity for dreams to enlighten and deepen our comprehension of our inner selves and our role in the world.

  

###### Kundson:

  
The difference in understanding between Stephanie and her therapist provides a richer understading on the debate of the 'realness' of dreams. Stephanie's view of her dream as authentically 'real' reflects an innate recognition of its relevance to her psychological and emotional well-being. This contrasts with her therapist's potentially more clinical and dismissive attitude toward the dream and Stephanie's understanding of the dream. This difference underscores how an individual's subjective experience ultimately determines the significance and effects they derive from their dreams.   
  
Rather than interpreting the dream through the lens of representational symbolism, as her therapist attempted by suggesting the dream reflected her precarious health and need for hospitalization; Stephanie's journey through the dreamscape transcended the constraints of mere symbolism, defying the interpretive lens her therapist attempted to impose. Rather than reducing her nocturnal odyssey to a mere reflection of her fragile physical state and the perceived need for confinement, Stephanie embraced a profound experiential and phenomenological perspective. For her, the dream was not a symbolic representation of her internal turmoil but a direct, immersive odyssey that reconnected her with the depths of her corporeal existence, allowing her to plunge into the vast ocean of intense emotion that coursed through her very being.  
  
Stephanie's account of her anorexia dream in the Knudson reading demonstrates how she treated a dream encounter with a wise woman as profoundly 'real' and transformative, despite her therapist initially dismissing it as imaginary. By heeding the dream wisdom, Stephanie was able to make vital changes to overcome her eating disorder. Her example reveals how dreams can serve as authentic sources of self-knowledge and inspiration when we are open to their messages.

  

###### Indrisano:

  
Ralph's Dream of Socrates functions as a symbolic narrative specific to his life experiences and inner self. He had a 'real' impact by sparking his intellectual awakening and providing perspective on his life path amidst familial/societal pressures. The dream tapped into his deeper yearnings for education and self-actualization in a way his waking reality could not, particularly it acted a tool to navigate the challanges arising from the cultural and value conflicts within his community. Socrates symbolically represented the type of enlightened mentor Ralph craved.

Hi Samir! What a great, reflective analysis of this weeks readings. I agree with you! Dreams may not be "real" but surely effect our reality through emotions, thoughts, and behavior they evoke.

I think I agree with Craigs analysis of dreams, saying they dive into our fears and dreams. I agree that we should pay attention to our dreams and it could be an interesting way to understand ourselves, but of course there seems to be a cap of the "power" of dreams. 

I think Knudsons story about Stephanie was interesting because it really illustrates how important background, expirience, and intentions effects the interpretations of dreams. Even if they are analyzing the same dream. I liked how you stated the importance of this reading, that we need to be open to their messages to benefit from the "authentic" insight dreams provide. 

Another greate narrative of drems providing a type of self awakening that would not be realized (at least in the same way) in waking reality. 

Thanks for your post!

# Session 8

This is a relatively short novel by the science fiction writer Ursula K. LeGuin. She is the daughter of two anthropologists and her works are known to have strong anthropological themes. This story is about a man whose dreams have the power to change external reality. Not all of his dreams have this power; only those he calls 'effective dreams.' Because reality shifts in the story, you have to read somewhat carefully to follow the changes that take place, though the stability of the two main characters helps to orient you throughout.  

I think the first chapter is one key to understanding the novel. Pay close attention to the opening paragraph on the jelly fish and then how it transitions into the apartment of the main character. Something happens between the two stable scenes that has to his eyelids being burned and fallen concrete and then radiation sickness. These themes will come back again later in the story, as will the month of April and the year 1998. 

Beyond this, just read the first six chapters for content and follow the story. I think you will enjoy it.

Read 

- _Dao De Jing/Tao Te_ _Ching_ (short intro)
- _Tao Te Ching_ 1-12 (these are very short chapers)
- _Lathe of Heaven_, Chapters 1-6; Take part in LH Discussion 1
**Due April 18, 11.59 PM**

Discuss at least three of the following:

1. What did you think of Chapters 1-12 of the Tao Te Ching? Was there one passage in particular you found interesting or instructive?
2. Note how the novel begins with the jelly fish. Is there an echo of the Tao Te Ching here?
3. Note also the transition from the jellyfish to George Orr - read the passage carefully. What is trapping George physically? How does he get out of it? Is he dreaming of this?
4. At the end of chapter 2, Dr. Haber reacts to Orr's dream and the picture of the horse on his wall. Do you see evidence here that Haber now believes that Orr does have the power he claims to have, i.e., Orr's dreams can change reality? 
5. Discuss some event in Chapters 3-5 that you find interesting, crucial, confusing, Taoist, etc. 
6. In chapter 6, Orr states that he has not right to change the world. Do you agree with him? Or do you agree with Haber that given the dream power that Orr has it is incumbent on him to use it to change things for the better?
7. How does the theme of utopia emerge in the story? Does it begin in a utopian or dustpan future? 
8. What do you think of the characters? 
9. What message or messages do you see emerging from the story?

2. The passage resonate with the idea of being in harmony with the natural world and the notion of yeilding or entrusting oneself to the greater flow of life. The jelly fish is hung in the fabric of the currents without resistance. This reflect the Taoist concept of Wu Wei, effortless action, which encourages actions that are in harmony with the flow of life. 

3. George seems to be in sleep paralysis as it states "he could not turn his head, for blocks of fallen concrete pinned him down and the steel rods projecting from their cores held his head in a vise". it does not clearly state how he got out of this. The passage simply starts narration after he got out of sleep paralysis and we do not know how. I suppose becuase the passage's story continuity is discrete, he is still dreaming. At one moment he is on the concrete steps, next on the baloon bed. 

4. Haber did indeed know that Orr possed effective dreaming powers. As it states Haber had "awful chills at the pit of his chest" which passed, however, when asked by Orr if he remembered the picture on the wall being a photograph of Mount Hood, Haber loosely lets out that "I happned to be looking at it" and stops abrubtly when his glance passes sidelong the mural. Suggesting that when Orr was being fed suggestive dream ideas Haber was looking at the picture of Mt.Hood.

Hi Samir,

I agree with you about the jellyfish and the idea of going with the flow. The jellyfish drifted along with no resistance. I can see that George is being trapped in sleep paralysis even though it’s not directly stated how he got out but it seems like he’s still in a dream state.

Lathe of Heaven

[COLLAPSE](https://umb.umassonline.net/webapps/discussionboard/do/message?action=list_messages&course_id=_65981_1&nav=discussion_board_entry&conf_id=_108078_1&forum_id=_244400_1&message_id=_3096561_1#)

Let's take a stab at Ursula Le Guin's _The Lathe of Heaven_. It's a story where dreams aren't just dreams, but tools to reshape the world. You've got George Orr, a man afraid of his own head hitting the pillow. A solid premise, might remind one of those nights when every dream felt like running from the bulls—thrilling, but not something you'd want to turn real.

Now, Le Guin writes clean. That's good. She doesn't clutter her sentences with frills or fuss. She cuts straight to the point, much like a good, clean jab in boxing. But, she's weaving this tapestry of sci-fi and psychology, tossing in a fair bit of Eastern philosophy. Makes one think she's trying to serve a banquet on a barstool. Interesting, yes, but maybe more than you need when all you want is a stiff drink and a clear story.

Dr. Haber, the antagonist, now there's a fellow with ambitions that stretch further than his grasp. The man fancies himself a god, tinkering with Orr’s dreams to reshape the world. It’s the kind of hubris that leads to trouble. Makes you think of those tourists in Pamplona, running with the bulls without a lick of sense. Dangerous, but damn if it doesn't make for a good show.

Le Guin throws in a love interest, Heather. It's a nice touch, adds a bit of human warmth to the chilly philosophical air of the story. A bit of romance never hurt a narrative, so long as it’s more than window dressing.

Overall, _The Lathe of Heaven_ mixes the fantastic with the mundane, sort of like mixing grain alcohol with your morning coffee. It'll wake you up, get you thinking, might even give you a bit of a headache. It's a potent brew, heavy on the mind, perhaps a touch too ambitious in its reach. But that's Le Guin for you—never one to shy away from the big questions, like a matador gracefully sidestepping a charging bull.

  

The manipulation of dreams by Dr. Haber is analyzed as a metaphor for the overreach of technological or political power in our society. Sivak draws parallels to contemporary issues such as surveillance, artificial intelligence, or genetic engineering, emphasizing the cautionary tale embedded within Le Guin's sci-fi setting.

  

Sivak hones in on the central dynamic between George Orr, the dreamer with the unsettling power to alter reality, and Dr. Haber, the visionary yet morally ambiguous psychiatrist. This relationship, a core element of the narrative, is dissected as a profound commentary on ethical responsibility and the human propensity to manipulate and control.

  

George Orr's got this knack for dreaming things into being, which would be handy if you were dreaming up bullfights and whiskey, but less so when your dreams reshape the whole world. Dr. Haber, the fellow trying to play chess with Orr's dreams, decides he's going to fix the world one dream at a time. The problem with playing God, you see, is you're not God, and things tend to get messy.  
  
As for how it wraps up, let's just say it's not with a neat bow. Orr finally learns to dream properly, or "effectively," as Haber would put it, putting an end to Haber’s manipulations. The world gets set right, not in a grand (because Orr chooses to do nothing), sweeping victory but in a quiet, almost unnoticed way. It's Taoist, if you think about it—going with the natural flow, letting the universe sort itself out without forcing it.

  

Is it a Taoist novel? Well, it sure dances around Taoist ideas like a cat on a hot tin roof. The whole notion of doing without doing, or "wu wei," slips through the pages. Orr's passive resistance to controlling his dreams reflects that—letting things happen as they should, not as you want them to. (clearly evident form the ending)

Hi Samir, it sounds like you really like bullfighting! I wouldn't really categorize Heather as a love interest personally, because while she does act as one in some of George's realities she also stands on her own as an independent character in others. I also struggled to find the themes you discussed from Spivack's work regarding genetic engineering and AI? But I find your interpretation that Orr learned to dream effectively at the end interesting, because I read it as kind of the opposite- Orr finally letting go of his fears of and dependence on effective dreaming.
