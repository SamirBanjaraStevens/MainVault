Analysis of Archaeological materials 

## Prehistoric Technology

How to determine what types of techonology were used in the past, archaeologits use ethnoarchaeology, experimental replication, and wear patterns.

#### Ethnoarchaeology

Study modern groups, and look at their behaviour to extrapolate it back to the archaeological record. An example of this might be studying the behaviour of the techonology and tools used by modern hunter gatherers to see how that matches up with an archaeological site where one can examine ancient hunter gatherers.

#### Experimental Archaeology

Experimental archaeology is when you try to replicate the pre-historic techology you are intrested in. For example you might try to make your own projectile points and stone tools. One might try to grind maize using types of ground stone implements. Other have tried to replicate the construction of an egyptian aulas, all using technology that might have only been avaiable to people in the pre-historic times they are investagating. 

#### Wear Patterns

How to look at how tools were used? Done by examining wear patterns. This can be done by looking at the edge of a tool most often underneath a microscope.

Striations often seen on bottom of the tool may relate to the movement of the tool in a haft. Indicate the tool was hafted to a spear. 

Can look at wear pattern of teeth. Can indicate a weaver by examing the marks that are left on their teeth.

We can examine people bones. For example someone who is a grinder, uses ground stone implements to grind wheat. There is alot of stress placed on their knee, big toe, and lower spine. X-ray's indicate the big toe woulve been hyperflexd and damaged, and the knee and lower spine may have bony growths as well.

In Crete, Archaeologits faily recently found a woman skeleton that showed unusual signs of weat. The muscles on her right side were very developed and the cartilidge on her hip and knee joints was worn leaving the bones smooth and ivory-like. This was a result of her flexing her leg and kicking a potter's wheel would have worn out the joints. Now we know she was a female potter.

How would modern day occupations impact the skeleton. For example, if you are a proffesional athelete, you might have more break and fractures compared to a person with a desk job. Even with a desk job, something as simple as tunnel syndrome, moving the mouse on a computer, around can affect your skeleton.

## Prehistoric Enviorment

Investagating the prehistoric enviorment plays a huge role in archarology. One of the big intrests is how people were able to adapt to different enviorments. So there are a number of methods we can use to look at early enviorments such as Palynology which is pollen analysis, it can indicate what might have been growing in the past.You can look at Phytoliths, which are sillica particles of plants, which can also indicate what mighve been growing in the past. Or Faunal analysis, which is examing animal bones. We can also look at soil core or ice cores.

#### Pollen Grains

By looking at pollen recovered in the archaeological record you can see what types of plants were growing in the past, allowing you to determine what type of enviorment there was. 

#### Grass Phytoliths 

Phytoliths are sillica partices that are preserved over long periods of times. By examening these, you can also determine what type of plants mightve been growing. An example is grass phyoliths from Amud Cave, Israel which is a Neanderthal site.

An example of pollen examation is on the pollen profile for southeastern Connecticut between 14,000 years ago and the present. The pollen falling on Connecticut between 14,000 and 12,000 years ago is simillar to the pollen percentages of modren Artic Tundra. Indicating what life mightve been life during this time.

#### Faunal Analysis

Recovery of Faunal material or animal bones can also give indication of prehistoric enviorment. This can tell you what animal woulve been living in a certin area in early times. By knowing what animals were living there you can extrapolate that to determien what that enviorment might have been like.

#### Soil Core

Soil core provide another good way to look at prehistoric enviorments.

For example researcher Dave Hodel was examining the soil core form Chichancanab in the Yucatan to determine the possibility of a drought casuing the Maya collapse.
What he did was look at small shelled organisims called Foraminifera, that were found in the soil core. 
Within the sheel of the organisims you can measure the ratio of oxygen 16 and 18 isotopes, this allows you to look at periods between wet and dry. 
David Hodel matched up this oxygen isotope data with that of Maya archeological excavation. 
We know that the Maya collapse happens at the end of the classic period and into the post classes. 
He dound a series of three droughts that are associated with that time period, suggesting that a drought was at least one contributer to the Maya collapse. 

#### Ice Core

Examining the ratio between lighter oxygen 16 and heavier oxygen 18 isotopes and ice cores is another way of help determine early enviorment.
In fact you have more oxygen 16 isotopes, that suggest tempertures were cooler in that time period. Greenland ice sheet under colder temperatures contains more of the lighter oxygen 16 isotopes.


## Prehistoric Diet

Examining prehistoric diet is another aspect of early culture archelogits are intrested in. There are a number of ways to do that.
- Pollen and Phytolith analysis
- Faunal analysis
- Wear pattern on teeth
- Types of tools used - hunting, plant processing
- Maltutrition - Harris Lines, porous Lesions, Enamel Hypoplasia, tooth decay
- Residue analysis
- Chemical analysis of bone
- Coprolite analysis
- Midden - Trash


Pollen and Phytolith analysis and Faunal analysis can also tell us what groups of people were eating. If you find a field of a lot of maize pollen that might tell you that they were growing maize. You can also look at Pollen and Phyoliths in the botton of clay vessels, which could tell you about diet. 

#### Faunal Analysis

Doing faunal analysis or looking at animal bone could also tell you about diet. For example if you find pig bones with cut marks, this could indicate that they most likely were butchered with stone tools and that this was a part of the diet. 

#### Wear Patterns

Diet could also be examined by lookingn at wear pattenrs of teeth. For example if you have alot of grit particles from grinding stones in the wheat flour, this will cause a change in your dentition.

#### Types of tools used - hunting, plant processing

The different types of tool artifacts you find at an archeologicla site could also tell you about diet. For example if there was alot of hunting of animals for meat, then you would most likely find alot of projectile points at your site. On the other hand is plant processing was essientail to the group, you would find Mano's and Metate's used to grind plants. 

How does technology now might have impacted diet? Cars, fast food, refridgrators, microwave, instant pot. These all revolutinized people interact with food.

#### Porous Lesions

Indicate lack of iron, thus lack of meat in diet.

During the Late Classic at the Mayan side of Copan in Hondorus, Archaeologsts found high percentage of commomnor had Porus Lesion in their skulls indicating amenia, a lack of iron. But as the Maya civilization began to collapse in 900AD both commonnors and the elite had Porus Lesions, inducating malnutrituion had spred through all segments of their society. 

#### Dental Hypoplasia

Horizontal linear defects in tooth enamel indicate episodes of physiological stress and growth arrest in tooth formation, suggesting malnutrition. 

#### Ancient Tooth Decay

We see the development of cavaties, which were not seen before the development of agriculture.

#### Chemical Analysis of Bone

Gives us information on early diet. 
Food and water have strotium values that reflect their geographical origin because strontium weathers from the hot rock into groundwater, river water and overlying soild and is then transfered into plants an danimals. Establishing if a person has an isotope ratio that is consistent with locally grown food or locally sourced food and water. If they dont have a isotope ratio that is consistent with the locally growwn food or sourced water, then they importend resources or the person had moved from a different area.

#### Coprolite Analysis

Coprolite refers to fossalized feceses that are found in archaeological context. In human fosalized feces you can tell what people were eating by identfiying seeds, fibers, animal bones, fish scales and other types of things. Exactly what an indivisual mightve been eating. 

#### Midden

Midden is trash. For example examning trash that has alot of butchred animal bones inside of it or a midden pile with a lot of shell shows us exactly what groups of people were eating. 


## Trade

Archaeologits are also intrested in examinign trade and exchange between different groups. We can do so by using Visual/Macroscopic Evidence or Petrographic Analyis (Analysis of mineral in thin section) ot Trace elements analysis (study of elements that occur naturally in mineral in soil and sediment. trace elements serve as 'fingerprints' for artifact raw material sources.)

#### Visual/Macroscopic Evidence

Marine shell disc beads recovered from Cahal Pech, Beliz are made of shells from the sea. But this site is an inland site, so in order to get these beads, members of the site would have to trade with groups along the coast.

#### Petrographic Analysis

Examing certin mineral in a thin section. For example on a thin sliced part of Sampoperro Red Vessel shows minerals. Volcanic glass can be observed on a microscopic picture of this thin section. Suggesting volcanic ash was used in the production of this vessel. But there are no volcanos where this vessel was found, suggesting the vessel came in from sompleace else or that the volcanic ash came from somewhere else. Though there is the chance that ash clouds deposited materials into the area.

#### Trace Element Analysis

Techniques that allows us to look at the chemical composition of the material to determine it origin. For example Obsidian spear points from mexico were actually from a volcano in El Chayal, Guatamala. Indicating trade between these areas.


## Social Organization and Ideology

Belif Systems of a group.

#### Dolni, Vestonice Venus Figurine
- one of the oldest depictions of a women.
- what does it mean?
- No writting so we dont know what its supposed to represent.

#### Lascaux Cave
- Earliest art
- what does it mean?

#### Stela A 
Copan, Hondurus
- construsted for 18 Rabbit
- proclaims that he and his kingdom is equal to thosse at Tikal, Palenque and Calakmul at AD 731.
- How do we know that is true?
- 18 rabbit could be just lying.
