### Introduction 

Consider the nature of personal space. In the past, our houses and communication devices smaller, and our concept of personal space quite different. Today, step into an elevator and you're thrust into a unique social experiment. People crowd into this confined space, adhering to a peculiar code of conduct: avoiding eye contact, facing the door, meticulously respecting personal space to a point that almost borders on comedy. It's an awkward dance, a ballet of bashfulness. I like it.

Yet, rewind to the past, and this scenario changes dramatically. Imagine being in an elevator without the option to feign busy-ness on your phone, no digital bubble to shield you. You would be compelled to engage in the art of elevator small talk. The horror of needing to verbally communicate with the elevator operator – "Third floor, please" – is almost unthinkable.

In such a time, my anxiety would skyrocket. No airpods to drown out the world, no smartphone screen to act as a barrier. I would transport this modern concept of personal space back to the past. A bubble of solitude, a personal sanctuary, where one can observe the world from a comfortable, unobtrusive distance. 


### Discussion 1

My answers to the True or False questions were largely accurate, but I was tripped up by question 5: "Early agricultural communities were healthier than hunter-gatherers." Initially, I thought this was true, under the assumption that a stable food source equates to better nutrition. However, it was surprising to learn that early farmers actually had poorer nutrition. This revelation challenges my understanding of health in historical contexts, especially since I had equated a consistent food supply with proper nutrition. The idea that being shorter than hunter-gatherers correlates with poorer health is still somewhat perplexing to me. It raises the question of whether there's a direct anthropological link between height and health.

Question 3 also presented a challenge: "Anyone who is interested is allowed to dig to investigate the past in most countries." I had assumed that property owners have the liberty to excavate their land at will. However, I now understand that while this might be true for personal exploration, any commercial or academic excavation, especially on land owned by others, definitely requires proper permits. This distinction makes sense, considering the importance of preserving archaeological integrity.
