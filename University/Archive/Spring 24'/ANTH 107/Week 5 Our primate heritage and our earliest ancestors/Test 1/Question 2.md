### If you were interested in the diet of an ancient group, what type of things would you look for in the archaeological record?

## Prehistoric Diet

Examining prehistoric diet is another aspect of early culture archelogits are intrested in. There are a number of ways to do that.
- Pollen and Phytolith analysis
- Faunal analysis
- Wear pattern on teeth
- Types of tools used - hunting, plant processing
- Maltutrition - Harris Lines, porous Lesions, Enamel Hypoplasia, tooth decay
- Residue analysis
- Chemical analysis of bone
- Coprolite analysis
- Midden - Trash


Pollen and Phytolith analysis and Faunal analysis can also tell us what groups of people were eating. If you find a field of a lot of maize pollen that might tell you that they were growing maize. You can also look at Pollen and Phyoliths in the botton of clay vessels, which could tell you about diet. 

#### Faunal Analysis

Doing faunal analysis or looking at animal bone could also tell you about diet. For example if you find pig bones with cut marks, this could indicate that they most likely were butchered with stone tools and that this was a part of the diet. 

#### Wear Patterns

Diet could also be examined by lookingn at wear pattenrs of teeth. For example if you have alot of grit particles from grinding stones in the wheat flour, this will cause a change in your dentition.

#### Types of tools used - hunting, plant processing

The different types of tool artifacts you find at an archeologicla site could also tell you about diet. For example if there was alot of hunting of animals for meat, then you would most likely find alot of projectile points at your site. On the other hand is plant processing was essientail to the group, you would find Mano's and Metate's used to grind plants. 

How does technology now might have impacted diet? Cars, fast food, refridgrators, microwave, instant pot. These all revolutinized people interact with food.

#### Porous Lesions

Indicate lack of iron, thus lack of meat in diet.

During the Late Classic at the Mayan side of Copan in Hondorus, Archaeologsts found high percentage of commomnor had Porus Lesion in their skulls indicating amenia, a lack of iron. But as the Maya civilization began to collapse in 900AD both commonnors and the elite had Porus Lesions, inducating malnutrituion had spred through all segments of their society. 

#### Dental Hypoplasia

Horizontal linear defects in tooth enamel indicate episodes of physiological stress and growth arrest in tooth formation, suggesting malnutrition. 

#### Ancient Tooth Decay

We see the development of cavaties, which were not seen before the development of agriculture.

#### Chemical Analysis of Bone

Gives us information on early diet. 
Food and water have strotium values that reflect their geographical origin because strontium weathers from the hot rock into groundwater, river water and overlying soild and is then transfered into plants an danimals. Establishing if a person has an isotope ratio that is consistent with locally grown food or locally sourced food and water. If they dont have a isotope ratio that is consistent with the locally growwn food or sourced water, then they importend resources or the person had moved from a different area.

#### Coprolite Analysis

Coprolite refers to fossalized feceses that are found in archaeological context. In human fosalized feces you can tell what people were eating by identfiying seeds, fibers, animal bones, fish scales and other types of things. Exactly what an indivisual mightve been eating. 

#### Midden

Midden is trash. For example examning trash that has alot of butchred animal bones inside of it or a midden pile with a lot of shell shows us exactly what groups of people were eating. 



If you're interested in understanding the diet of an ancient group, there are several key elements you would look for in the archaeological record to reconstruct their dietary habits comprehensively. Each of these elements provides a unique perspective on what ancient peoples ate, how they obtained their food, and the impact of their diet on their health.

1. **Pollen and Phytolith Analysis**: Search for microscopic plant remains within soil samples, pottery, and coprolites (fossilized feces). This can help identify the types of plants that were consumed or cultivated by the ancient group. The presence of specific types of pollen, such as maize, can indicate the cultivation and dietary inclusion of certain crops.
    
2. **Faunal Analysis**: Examine animal bones found at archaeological sites for butchery marks. These can reveal the types of animals that were consumed and how they were processed. For example, cut marks on pig bones might suggest pigs were part of their diet and processed using stone tools.
    
3. **Wear Patterns on Teeth**: Look for wear patterns and dental pathologies that can indicate dietary habits. For instance, the presence of grit from grinding stones in flour can lead to distinctive wear patterns on teeth, revealing the consumption of ground grains.
    
4. **Tool Use Analysis**: Analyze the types of tools found at archaeological sites. The presence of specific tools, like projectile points, can suggest hunting activities, while tools like mano and metate indicate plant processing.
    
5. **Malnutrition Markers**: Investigate skeletal remains for markers of malnutrition, which can provide insights into diet deficiencies:
    
    - **Porous Lesions**: Indicate a lack of iron, suggesting a diet deficient in meat.
    - **Harris Lines**: Reflect periods of growth arrest, often due to malnutrition.
    - **Enamel Hypoplasia**: Shows episodes of physiological stress, implying periods of malnutrition.
    - **Tooth Decay**: Indicates the consumption of carbohydrates, especially with the advent of agriculture.
6. **Residue Analysis**: Study residues on pottery or tools to identify specific foods that were processed or consumed. This can directly indicate the types of food prepared and eaten.
    
7. **Chemical Analysis of Bone**: Perform isotopic analysis on bones to determine the geographical origin of the diet. Strontium isotope analysis, for example, can reveal whether an individual consumed local or non-local foods, based on the strontium isotopic signature in their teeth and bones.
    
8. **Coprolite Analysis**: Examine fossilized human feces for direct evidence of consumed food. This can include identifiable seeds, fibers, and animal remains, offering a direct snapshot of an individual's meal.
    
9. **Midden Examination**: Investigate ancient trash piles for discarded food remains, such as animal bones and shells. This can provide clues to the broader diet of the population.




The element strontium (chemical symbol Sr) is particularly useful in this kind
of analysis. The ratio of the two isotopes of strontium varies between regions, and
(here’s the coolest part) the strontium becomes a part of your teeth as you are
developing, and your tooth enamel reflects the ratio of those isotopes when they
first developed (B. Fowler 2007). For example, the strontium isotope ratio in your
adult tooth enamel right now reflects the ratio when the enamel developed when
you were a little kid (the buds of your adult teeth were already in your upper
and lower jaws when you were an infant). It doesn’t change through time. So, if a
forensic anthropologist were to examine the strontium in your teeth today, he or
she could probably match it up with the geographic region in which you lived
when you were young, showing where you were born and where you spent the
beginning of your life. In an application of this form of analysis, for example, re-
searchers were able to determine that some of those buried in high-status graves
at the Bolivian sites of Tiwanaku and Chan Chan (see Chapter 13) were born
locally, and some were outsiders (Knudson et al. 2004).
The strontium in your bones, on the other hand, does change through
time, but very slowly, measured over the course of a decade. So, the strontium
isotope ratio in your bones isn’t necessarily a reflection of where you were
born but, instead, where you've lived for the last decade or so. Strontium
analysis of a bone from a man buried in a cave located at another Tiwanaku
site in southern Bolivia, for example, revealed that he had lived in the general
area for more than a decade. In other words, he was a local person and not
someone from outside of the region (Knudson et al. 2005). The geographic
origins of some of those buried at Stonehenge have been traced using their
strontium signatures (Chapter 9).
