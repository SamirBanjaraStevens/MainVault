### How would you approach the excavation of a small low status residential structure? What kinds of artifacts, features, and ecofacts would you expect to find and why?


# Background research
First step is background research. 

## Reading other people researhc
Which can be done through reading other research that has been done in the area recently or in the past. 

For example if this excavation took place in Yuctan in central America, reading a book published in 1841 by explorer John L. Stephens 'Incidents of travel in Central America Chipas and Yucatan' would be useful in understanding general information about out landscape or a book  published in 2020 about food tilted 'Her Cup For Sweet Cacao; Food in Ancient Maya Society' would shed light on the types of food we might find.

Additionally talking to the locals who work ,boots in the ground, in the community of the excavation site are helpful in understing the area. For example at St. George Caye Cemetery in 1930, archelogists were able to obtain pictures of Tomas Potts Sarcophagus through talkign with the locals.

## Maps
Research can also look like maps that might be published such as geological maps, soil maps and soil survey, vegetation maps, topographic maps.

We can organize the information in these maps through the use of Geographical Information System (GIS). We are able to visually organize mapping/geographic data into layers of visual information. This is a good way to also document my findings of the excavation site. Specfically in an archeological site GIS allows for organzietion by time period. 


# Surveying / Ground Reconnaissance

To locate articafacts archelogoits first implemet surface survey. Which is essitantly walking and looking down to possibly find remmants of architecture which may look like brick, or projectile poitns, or maybe pottery. Upon finding them imediately leave them where they are and mark them on a map. It may also look like searching for pigment samples. 

# Remote sensing

Remote sensing can be employed for the detection of subterranea features from the surface of the earth using satellite imagery, aerial photographs, LiDAR and geophysics.

Lidar specficaly can be used to revel buildigns, causeways, terraces features and other modifications.

Once the images have been analsyze, field work to confirm suspecsiosn is necessary
