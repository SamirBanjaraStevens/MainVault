Discuss the **importance of context** in *archaeological excavation*.
Be sure to **include a definition** of ***what context is*** in your answer and **distinguish** between *primary and secondary context*.

Materials should be left exactly as discovered to unveil potential connections among the remnants. The concept of "association" refers to the spatial relationships between archaeological artifacts, ecofacts, and features, implying that items found close together share a link.

Data gathering during excavations is facilitated by detailed lot record forms, ensuring every piece of information is captured with precision.

The investigation includes identifying the matrix, provenience, and associations of the site's artifacts and ecofacts. The "matrix" refers to the surrounding physical medium—be it soil, sand, rock, gravel, water, or plaster—which encases the archaeological data. Standardizing medium descriptions often involves the Munsell soil color chart, which can, for instance, help associate dark, greasy soil with organic material or middens.


Understanding an artifact's context—whether it remains in its primary context, undisturbed since its original deposition, or has been moved to a secondary context due to human or natural actions—adds depth to our interpretation. Primary context is further divided into use-related, where artifacts are found as they were used (like a spearhead in a deer's ribs), and transposed, where items are discarded post-use (e.g., a garbage pit).

Secondary context arises when items are relocated from their original setting, either through intentional human actions, such as looting, or natural events like earthquakes, floods, or even the burrowing activities of animals, which can alter the surrounding radiocarbon levels.
