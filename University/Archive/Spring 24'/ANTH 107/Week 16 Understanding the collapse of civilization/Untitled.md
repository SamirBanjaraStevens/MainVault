The temporally overlapping Late Stone Age of Africa and Upper Paleolithic of Europe and Asia were also times of invention and technological development when, as paleoanthropologist Lyn Wadley (2009) characterizes it, our ancestors first exhibited evidence of “complex cognition.” This is reflected by a series of either brand new technologies or older technologies that experienced a great leap forward. Among these technologies or behaviors that characterize the Late Stone Age and Upper Paleolithic are: (1) the reliance on new and improved stone-tool technologies; (2) new hunting and weapons technologies; (3) a broadening of the subsistence quest; (4) branching out in raw materials; (5) new uses for plant ma- terials; (6) the acquisition of raw materials from a great distance; (7) larger sites of population aggregation; (8) an abundance of nonutilitarian objects; (9) elaborate burials; and (10) symbolic expression through the production of art.

1. New and Improved Stone-Tool Technologies
I realize that in my discussion of stone-tool technology, I keep revisiting the les- sons learned in my experimental archaeology course where students attempt to replicate ancient stone tools. As I mentioned in Chapter 3, almost everyone is capable of making replicas of 2.4-million-year-old Oldowan choppers and flake tools. As I went on to note in Chapter 4, 1.8-million-year-old Acheulean handaxes are a bit more challenging, but some students are capable of making pretty good replicas. When it comes to the Upper Paleolithic stone-tool technol- ogies just mentioned, however, a far smaller proportion of my students become proficient at replicating the tools. Nonetheless, it is an interesting exercise, the most important lesson of which may be that the tools appear to be as much a re- flection of art as craft. Upper Paleolithic blade tools, in their graceful symmetry, appear to be the result of an attempt to make something as beautiful as it is useful. Their manufacture, therefore, is an entirely human process. Though in the previous chapter we saw that blade tools first appear in the African archaeological record about 500,000 years ago, and evidence for a blade-based stone-tool technology dates to 240,000 years ago in Kenya and 90,000 years ago in southern Africa, it wasn’t until as recently as 52,000 years ago that blade making spread into Asia and then Europe. For example, at Boker Tachtit in Israel (Marks 1990, 1993) and Ksar Akil in Lebanon (Ohnuma and Bergman 1990), the shift from Levallois technology to a stone-tool technology based on the production of elongated blades occurred by as much as 52,000 years ago at Ksar Akil and 45,000 years ago at Boker Tachtit (Figure 6.1; Marks 1993:12). South of this, in Africa, Late Stone Age sites like Haua Fteah Cave show this shift to have occurred by about 40,000 B.P. (Van Peer and Vermeersch 1990). In central and southeastern Europe, the shift from Mousterian flake to Upper Paleolithic blade production occurred before 40,000 B.P. (Svoboda 1993); in western Europe, the shift seems to have occurred a bit later, about 38,000 B.P. (Allsworth-Jones 1990). The blade technologies of the Upper Paleolithic are short-lived, and change is greatly accelerated. In western Europe, for example, the Aurignacian tradition consisted of a specific set of tools that included retouched blades, engraving tools called burins, and stone scrapers, and it is dated to between 34,000 B.P.and 27,000 B.P. From 27,000 B.P. to 21,000 B.P, the Gravettian tradition developed, with its emphasis on smaller blades and denticulate knives. The Solutrean tradition, dated from 21,000 B.P. to 16,000 B.P, is the most striking of all, characterized by finely made, bifacially flaked, symmetrical, leaf-shaped projectile points. Solutrean points are among the most finely made stone tools ever found (Figure 6.2). The Solutrean was followed by the Magdelanian, from 16,000 B.P. to 11,000 B.P, when the emphasis was not on stone tools at all but rather on bone and antler, with the attendant production of microblades. Artifacts from the various industries of the Upper Paleolithic reveal two very important facts. First, lithic technology had become more complex and elabo- rate, with a number of different manufacturing techniques that used stone more efficiently; produced more effective tools for cutting, scraping, piercing, and so on; and yielded objects far more symmetrical, balanced, and aerodynamic than those of the Middle Paleolithic. From our twenty-first-century vantage point (or, perhaps, bias), Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age industries produced tools that are more aesthetically pleasing, more artfully rendered, than those of earlier traditions. Second, and equally as important, the profusion of specific tool-tradition names points to one of the most salient differences between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic: Whereas Middle Paleolithic technology was marked by relative homogeneity temporally and geographically, Upper Paleolithic technology was characterized by an explosion of toolmaking diver- sity marked by relatively rapid change and far greater geographic variability.

3. New Hunting and Weapons Technologies
Based in part on a detailed analysis of the fracture patterns present on sharp- pointed stone tools recovered there, researchers believe that residents of Sibudu Cave, South Africa, may have developed an early version of the bow and arrow as much as 64,000 years ago (Lombard and Phillipson 2010). The bow and arrow is a complex tool whose production requires a series of inventions and skills— understanding the ability to store energy through the bending of a carefully carved piece of wood; the manufacture of a flexible, durable string to add to the stored energy and to release it suddenly; the creation of knots that can both hold tightly and be easily unhooked; and the manufacture of an aerodynamic projectile. Also in Sibudu Cave, in a level dating to more than 70,000 years ago, scien- tists discovered on some of the stone-tool bases a residue consisting of a mixture of Acacia gum, beeswax, and ochre (Wadley, Hodgskiss, and Grant 2009). In a replicative experiment, those same scientists determined that the residue was a carefully crafted adhesive intended to firmly attach stone tools to handles. As they point out, the production of the adhesive was a “multilevel” operation (p. 9593), requiring a consistent and coordinated set of procedures done in the correct order, with ingredients mixed together in proper proportions and heated to the correct temperature for a successful outcome. The spear-thrower was an innovation of the Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age. In a wonderful example of how words can move across temporal and cultural barriers, modern scholars often use the term “atlat]” instead of “spear-thrower.” Atlatl is a word in the native language of the Aztecs of Mexico (see Chapter 12). The word was picked up by the Spanish invaders of Mesoamerica, some of whom faced atlatl-using warriors, and from there entered into various European languages, including English. So we now commonly apply a sixteenth-century Aztec word for devices developed in Europe more than 30,000 years ago. The atlatl is an elongated, hooked handle that attaches to the butt of a spear and effectively increases the length of the arm of the person throwing the spear. A longer arm increases the contact time between the inception of the throw and the release, allowing for greater accuracy, speed, and distance; it works for the same reason a baseball pitcher with a long arm can often throw the ball harder and faster than can someone with a shorter pitching arm. The spear-thrower is a remarkable example of applied physics prac- ticed by ancient humans. By artificially extending the arm—and by exploiting the stored energy in the bending shaft of the dart as it is thrown—both ancient people and the Aztecs were able to dramatically increase the accuracy as well as the power with which they could launch a spear in the quest for food or in battle. Experiments have compared the force of various methods of propelling a projectile. The force of a dart thrown with a spear-thrower far exceeds that gener- ated by a hand-thrown spear, a traditional bow, or even a modern compound bow (Karl and Bruchert 1997). Spears propelled by a spear-throwing device have been clocked at more than 100 mph, and a computer-designed spear-thrower recently produced a record throw of 250 m (over 800 ft)! Spear-throwers date back to as much as 30,000 years ago. The bearers of this technology certainly had an advantage in the hunt over those who needed to get much closer to large, dangerous animals in order to successfully spear them. A 13,000-year-old spear-thrower from Enléne Cave, France, was carved from rein- deer antler (Dennell 1986). Along with being a useful tool, this spear-thrower is far more beautiful than it had to be; the handle was finely carved into the image of two ibexes (mountain goats) locked in combat (Figure 6.3). Finally, there is circumstantial evidence for another hunting technology at Sibudu Cave in South Africa. Lyn Wadley (2010) suggests that the abundance of small, forest-dwelling animals among the food remains dating there to 65,000 years ago is an indication that the residents may have developed traps and snares, as these smaller creatures would have been extremely difficult to hunt with projectiles.

3. Broadening the subsistence Base
Undeniably, the hunting of big game—megafauna—made a significant contribution to the subsistence of Upper Paleolithic people. In central and eastern Europe, for example, sites dating between 28,000 B.P. and 10,000 B.P. reflect the major role of the woolly mammoth in the subsistence base of Upper Paleolithic people. At a single site, Dolni Vestonice I, researchers have identified the remains of more than 100 mammoths butchered by the inhabitants (Soffer 1993). At this same site, butchering marks have been located on the remains of horse and rein- deer as well. The situation is much the same in Africa and western Europe, where Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age inhabitants exploited local large game animals. In Siberia, the site of Mal’ta near Irkutsk shows extensive hunting of woolly mammoth and reindeer. In South Africa, at Late Stone Age sites such as Die Kelders Cave and Eland’s Bay Cave, remains of eland (a large antelope) are abundant, and there is evidence of the hunting of the Cape buffalo, a far more dangerous animal and one avoided during the Middle Stone Age (Klein 1983). In the Upper Paleolithic of western Europe, at sites such as Abri Pataud in France, excavators found the bones of reindeer, elephant, horse, and wild cattle (R. White 1982). At Mother Grundy’s Parlour, a cave occupation site in Great Britain dating to about 12,000 B.P, the remains ofwoolly rhinoceros and mammoth, reindeer, and wild horse were found (C. Smith 1992). Also in Great Britain, Gough’s Cave shows extensive use of wild horse and red deer more than 12,200 years ago (C. Smith 1992). Following the pattern established at a few Middle Stone Age sites of ana- tomically modern humans in Africa, most notably Klasies River Mouth, Die Kelders, and Blombos Cave, the remains of fish have been found at Late Stone Age sites. The same South African sites just mentioned, for example, show evi- dence of the extensive reliance on seals, penguins, dolphins, mollusks, and flying shorebirds (Henshilwood et al. 2002; Klein 1983:43). The bones or shells of these organisms have been found, along with grooved-stone net weights used in fishing and possible early fishhooks (called “gorges”) that were baited and attached to lines. Small mammals also contributed to the food quest. At Dolni Vestonice I and at the nearby site of Pavlov,there is indirect evidence of the use of nets in hunt- ing small game (Pringle 1997). Fragments of netting made by the inhabitants of these sites, dating from between 29,000 and 22,000 years ago, had accidentally been pressed into the clay floors of the inhabitants’ houses. In a few cases, those houses burned and the impressions of the netting were preserved in the baked clay. The nets were sophisticated, indicating a probable long tradition of net weaving (Adovasio, Soffer, and Klima 1996). The netting mesh was too fine to have been used to capture large animals, but there are plenty of bones of smaller creatures, including hare and fox, at these sites. A large hare can produce 6 pounds of meat and a pelt. Driving small mammals like hares into nets is an efficient hunting technique that all members of a social group can participate in—the very young and the aged, pregnant or nursing females, and, of course, young males in their prime. It seems likely, therefore, that net hunting played a substantial role in subsistence at these and other sites that date to the same period (Pringle 1998). Plant foods also contributed to the diets of our anatomically modern human ancestors. Sarah Mason has found the burned residue of edible taproots in hearths at Dolni Vestonice I (Pringle 1998). And berries have been found in hearths at other Upper Paleolithic sites. It is highly unlikely that Upper Paleolithic people overlooked important sources of protein, carbohydrates, or vitamins available in their territories. Portrayals of ancient hunters fighting a daily duel to the death with huge, ag- gressive beasts may offer us a romantic image, but it seems an unlikely strategy for survival. It is far more likely that the people of the Upper Paleolithic subsisted on a broad spectrum of foods, including the meat from animals both large and small, birds, fish, seeds, nuts, berries, and starchy roots. Archaeological evidence is finally beginning to support this sensible reconstruction.

4. Branching Out in Raw Materials and Developing New Technologies 
We begin to see a branching out in the use of raw materials by anatomically ‘modern people in the African Middle Stone Age. In the same Middle Stone Age Layers at Blombos Cave dating to 77,000 years ago in which incised ochre rods were recovered (see the Overview of this chapter), researchers found 28 precisely crafted bone tools (Henshilwood et al. 2001; Figure 6.4). Inhabitants of the cave ‘made bone awls and apparent spearpoints in a way that implies a strict adher- ence to a sequence of steps throughout the toolmaking process. As the formal and consistent fashioning of bone tools is not seen at the sites of premodern humans, the Blombos researchers conclude that this is one indicator of the technological sophistication of the anatomically modern humans who inhabited the cave, more than 25,000 years before the inception of the Late Stone Age in Africa and the Upper Paleolithic in Europe and Asia. ‘Although the use of bone tools after 50,000 years ago may not have been absolutely innovative, the use of bone, as well as ivory, antler, and shell for the production of tools used in sewing—for example, awls, punches, and needles— and for hunting equipment—for example, spear tips—is a virtual hallmark of the Upper Paleolithic. For example, along the Dest River in Russia, Upper Paleo- lithic sites have produced slotted daggers of reindeer antler. At the Kosoutsy site in this same region, reindeer antler was also used as a raw material to manufacture spearpoints for use in the hunt, and thin slivers of reindeer bone were used in the production of eyed needles (Borziyak 1993). ‘Eyed needles allowed for more precisely tailored and sewn clothing. The pro- duction of protective outergarments that were, at least to a degree, windproof and waterproof, with seams stitched tightly through the use of such needles, would have been extremely important as people spread into colder climates, fun- damentally inhospitable to our tropically evolved and adapted ancestors. In no small measure, tight, weatherproof seams enabled by thin, eyed needles made expansion into places like the Arctic a more reasonable possibility for ancient ‘humans. Direct evidence ofthe production of tailored clothing comes from the 22,000-year-old site of Sungir’, just north of Moscow, in Russia as well as Jouclas, in France (Dennell 1986). Beads used for fastening were found in a pattern in the ground at Sungir’, outlining what appears to have been pants, shirt or jacket, a cap, and shoes (Klein 1989; R White 1993). When rock shatters on its own as a result of freezing and thawing, by skittering along in a flowing stream, or even just by gravity hurling a stone downhill into another one, it can accidently and coincidently produce sharp, sometimes useful edges. It has never seemed to ‘me that it was that big of an intellectual leap for our an- cestors to have figured out that one can take out of the equation the serendipity of natural, fortuitous breakage and, instead, intentionally shatter rock in a consistent way to make tools with specific uses in mind. It does not surprise me that our ancestors figured this out more than 2.6 million years ago. This kind of obvious experiential evidence about what happens to rocks when you smash them, however, doesn’t really apply to the development of ce- ramic technology. There simply aren’t very many natural processes an individual regularly encounters in nature in which a high temperature is accidently ap- plied to a mushy, kind of sticky dirt, producing a durable, waterproof, and largely fireproof material. There’s no obvious pathway in nature to a “eureka” moment: “Hey, I bet I can intentionally shape a vessel from that mushy, sticky dirt, put it in a fire, and make a sweet pot or bowl for myself, suitable for cooking mammoth stew, serving salsa, or whatever.” Therefore, I am deeply impressed that our ancestors had figured exactly this out as much as 20,000 years ago. A number of Upper Paleolithic figurines found in Europe (some of the so-called Venus figurines discussed later in this chapter) were made from fired clay. Perhaps, in this case, the original intention was to pro- duce a figurine from that mushy, sticky dirt and then, “oops,” it was dropped in the fire by accident, and “wow,” instead of melting or burning, which you might have expected, it maintained its shape and became hard and durable. Perhaps of even greater significance than the accidental production of ce- ramic figurines was the manufacture of pottery vessels in China, at a site in Xianrendong Cave in Jiangxi Province. There, archaeologists have found ceramic sherds representing the oldest pottery discovered anywhere in the world so far. A series of radiocarbon dates derived from organic material collected from the lowest layer in the cave in which pottery sherds were also recovered produced dates in the range of 19,000 to 20,000 years ago (Wu et al. 2012). Certainly, this is impressive as an example of branching out in the use of raw materials and in the invention of a new technology. This is also significant in terms of what pottery vessels provide: efficient, durable, easily made cooking and storage vessels. Pottery is a game changer: Clay is abundant and easily obtained; a durable, waterproof cooking pot increases the ability to extract energy from various foods, including meats and starches (Carmody, Weintraub, and Wrangham 2011); sealable storage vessels can protect foods from rodents. The Chinese evidence indicates that this happened in the Upper Paleolithic/Late Stone Age and represents another sig- nificant technological achievement of the people who lived during this period. 

5. New Uses for Plant Materials
There is evidence in Sibudu Cave for a particular kind of domestic practice using local plant material. Archaeology in the cave revealed that more than 70,000 years ago, residents lined the floor with plant material, including species that possess a nat- ural insecticide (Wadley et al. 2011). Those who visit the cave today remark on the abundant presence of mosquitos in the area, so no doubt any natural way to keep these annoying and possibly disease-carrying insects away would have been helpful. 

7. The Acquisition of Raw Materials from a Great Distance 
The ability to obtain raw materials and manufactured goods from great distances might seem to be a feature strictly of modern societies. Look around your house and try counting the goods that originated in other countries—stereo equipment and cameras manufactured in Japan, clothing made in India, and so on. When I purchased my iPhone 6 a couple of months ago, I was able to tracks its progress  from a factory in China to my house in Connecticut. It took only about three days. Amazing. ‘Whereas Middle Paleolithic people relied on raw materials whose source was close to their habitations, in the Upper Paleolithic we see far more extensive use of raw materials available only at great distances from living sites. For example, at the Kostenki-Borshevo sites in Russia, inhabitants used local lithic materials (quartzite and brown and yellow flint) in making stone tools. Also used, how- ever, was a black flint that possessed superior chipping qualities (it chipped more regularly) but was not available in the Kostenki-Borshevo region. Trace element analysis (see Chapter 2) of the raw materials recovered at the site suggests that the flint obtained by the inhabitants of the Kostenki-Borshevo region for their artifacts actually came from a source 300 km (186 mi) distant (Klein 1969:227). The situation is much the same throughout the geographic extent of Upper Paleolithic cultures. For example, in Moravia, in south-central Europe, flint com- monly was moved across distances of 100 km (62 mi) from its source (Oliva 1993:52). In rare instances, apparently highly valued material like obsidian (volcanic glass) from Hungary is found in Paleolithic sites up to 500 km (310 mi) away (Oliva 1993:52). Even where quite serviceable stone was available locally, material obtain- able only from great distances was often used. Archaeologist Martin Oliva (1993) suggests that maintaining long-distance contacts through trade seems to have been more important than the specific qualities of the lithics themselves and that the stone and its trade took on more of a ritual meaning than just a utilitarian signifi- cance. The use of raw materials from great distances away by Upper Paleolithic peo- ples implies a greater reliance on trade with distant groups and perhaps also implies broader social networks (hypothetically maintained by seasonal get-togethers evi- denced at the aggregation sites) than anything seen in Middle Paleolithic contexts. 

8. Larger Sites of Population Aggregation 
Middle Paleolithic sites tend to be small, representative of the encampments of no- madic, opportunistic foragers, who took whatever resources they could wher- ever they became available, without much planning in advance (Binford 1984). Though Upper Paleolithic sites include similarly small foraging camps, much larger sites also date to the Upper Paleolithic. Randall White (1982) interprets these as places of aggregation, localities where numerous small bands of people would come together seasonally. The site of Mal'ta, in Siberia, for example, covers an area of some 600 m? (about 6,500 ft?; Chard 1974:20); it includes the remains of numer- ous dwellings whose frames were made from the large bones of woolly mammoth (Figure 6.5). This size is far larger than that of the standard Middle Paleolithic site. The settlement pattern of the Middle Paleolithic with its complement of small sites scattered across the landscape would seem to reflect a strategy of opportunistic foraging, where people followed resources wherever they might become available. The pattern of subsistence in the Upper Paleolithic appears to be different, at least in part, as reflected by the existence of large sites where popu- lations came together during a yearly cycle. People still lived in nomadic bands, but the movement of the band was no longer unrestricted, instead following a fixed yearly pattern where at least some seasonally occupied sites were returned to each year, perhaps by members of several bands.


During the Upper Paleolithic, therefore, the settlement pattern seems to indicate a shift to a fixed seasonal round as part of a strategy of logistical collecting (Binford 1984). Subsistence and movements were planned out in advance as people gained a detailed knowledge of their territory, seasonality, and the behavior and shifting locations of the plants and animals on which they subsisted. Some sites were continually visited by aggregations of related people during fixed and known times of the year when resources may have been particularly abundant at these places—for example, at a topographic bottleneck on a migra- tion route for large animals. Some of these sites, perhaps, became ritually sancti- fied through the use of artwork to denote the significance of a particular place to the members of the group. This possibility is discussed in the section on the appearance of artwork in the Upper Paleolithic and in “Issues and Debates.” 

8. Abundance of Nonutilitarian Objects
In my classes I see many students, men and women, wearing nonutilitarian items of personal adornment: necklaces, earrings, nose rings, tongue piercings, ear cufls, gauges, finger rings, bracelets, anklets, hairpins. Some have gold and silver drap- ing every extremity and dangling from a multitude of pierced body parts some of which I'd rather not think about. All our bodies look basically the same, built along one of two fundamental models: male or female. But we have invented nu- merous ways of decorating ourselves—defining, identifying, and distinguishing ourselves—with objects of adornment. Artifacts interpretable as items of personal adornment are rare at the sites of premodern humans. The Neandertal site of Arcy-sur-Cure is one of the very few places where multiple objects of personal adornment have been found associated with premoderns (see Figure 5.11). For the most part, stone, bone, antler, shell, or ivory jewelry is restricted to the sites of anatomically modern human beings. One of the oldest sites where such items of adornment have been found is the Grotte des Pigeons in Morocco, in northwestern Africa. Excavators recovered thirteen perforated mollusk shell ornaments there in a cave level dated to 82,000 years ago (Bower 2007). The perforations appear to have been made intentionally, and wear along the margins of the perforations likely resulted when the shells rubbed against a cord from which they likely were suspended. The same kind of perforated shells have been found in greater numbers at the previously mentioned Blombos Cave in South Africa. There, dating to 75,000 years ago in the same stratigraphic level in which the red ochre mentioned on page 188 was recovered, researchers have found 41 perforated mollusk shell beads (Henshilwood et al. 2004). The perforation appears at the same spot on 36 of the shells—on the back near the lip (Figure 6.6). As was true in the case of the Moroc- can artifacts, the location of the holes in the Blombos shells is rarely seen in nature and clearly seems to have been intentional, perhaps to hang the beads in a necklace. The Grotte des Pigeons and Blombos Cave beads date to the African Middle Stone Age, but it is in the Late Stone Age and Upper Paleolithic when there appears to be an explosion in the production of items of personal adornment and other no- nutilitarian objects. For example, a handful of 40,000-year-old sites in Africa, west Asia, and Europe have produced shell beads or perforated teeth, likely intended to be suspended from a necklace. Dating to 15,000 B.P, Malta, in central Asia (Chard 1974), has produced a wealth of items of adornment. A small child was found buried at Mal’ta with a neck- lace made of bone and antler beads (Figure 6.7). Also found were schematic carvings of birds, a carved bone plaque with designs consisting of dots and wavy lines etched or punched into the surface of the bone, and depictions of human beings (Figure 6.8). As Randall White (1982) points out, the appear- ance of items of personal adornment that were often painstakingly made, frequently out of exotic material that must have been difficult to obtain—and there- fore “expensive” in terms of time and effort to obtain it—is significant. In Whites view, such objects imply increasing awareness and importance of individual identity in Upper Paleolithic society. Whatever the specific significance of the development of items of personal adornment, it seems clear that people in the Upper Paleolithic were much like ourselves.

9. More Elaborate Burials
Whatever your philosophy or religion, the death of a loved one or the contemplation of one’s own mortal- ity is pretty momentous stuff. How we dispose of and memorialize our dead is a reflection of how we view death, and the archaeological record has much to tell us about how our ancestors dealt with the end of life. If the modern folktale is true, a woman in California (sometimes the story has it in Florida) was buried in a nightgown, seated at the wheel of her brand new Jaguar (or Porsche, take your pick). Thats certainly making a statement. More commonly, married people may be buried wearing their wedding bands. Devout Christians may be interred with a cross around their neck. Burying the dead with treasured personal items is a long-standing human tra- dition. Egyptian pharaohs were buried with food, jewelry, furniture—even other people (see Chapter 10). The emperors of imperial China were buried with char- iots and entire life-size ceramic armies of soldiers and horses (see Chapter 11). We see this pattern repeated over and over. Whether because it is believed that the deceased will need such items in the afterlife or simply because of the desire to place some items of personal identification with a departed friend, the practice of burying the dead with objects that were meaningful to them and their loved ones seems nearly universal. See the “Case Study Close-up” in this chapter for an example of elaborate ritual burials in the Upper Paleolithic.

10. Symbolic Expression Through the Production of Art
The first possible glimmerings of artistic expression by our anatomically modern human ancestors have now been traced back to about 164,000 years ago at Pin- nacle Cave on the Cape of South Africa (Gibbons 2007a). There, archaeologists recovered pieces of the red ochre. Red ochre is a form of hematite, a soft mineral consisting of iron oxide, actually ranging in color from near black through vari- ous shades of red and orange. Ground up into a powder and mixed with a binder (animal grease, egg white, or even saliva), ochre has been used by people all over the world to produce red-hued paint. The ochre pieces recovered at Pinnacle Cave had been worn down by the inhabitants. That may have resulted from the use of ochre powder in a glue used to make tools, but modern people also wear away ochre when they use the pieces like crayons for decorating their own bodies. It is at least possible that the inhabit- ants of Pinnacle Cave did the same thing. The use of red ochre by early human beings is also seen at Blombos Cave, also in South Africa, where more than 8,000 pieces were brought in by the inhabitants (Henshilwood et al. 2002; there are no natural ochre deposits in the cave). There, in a layer dated to about 100,000 years ago, researchers found 13 fragments of the mineral, all of which bore unmistakable evidence of incising in the form of a series of parallel lines (Balter 2009a). There also are fan-shaped etchings, cross- hatching, and series of wavy lines. Pieces of modified red ochre were also found by the Blombos excavators in a level of the cave dating to 77,000 years ago. Two of the larger chunks of the ochre found at this level had regularly spaced incised markings in the form of crosshatching across their lengths, intersected at a right angle by another set of incised, parallel lines (Figure 6.9). Henshilwood and colleagues (Heshilwood et al. 2011) also discovered what appear to be two ochre-based paint-making stations at Blombos Cave in South Africa in a level dating to 101,000 years ago. Both paint-making kits consisted of an abalone shell and a quartzite cobble grinding stone the appropriate size to fit into the shell itself (in one case the cobble was, indeed, found nestled in the shell). Ground ochre was found on the interior surfaces of both shells, the surfaces of which showed scraping and scratching marks from their use as a grinding surface. The team also found traces of ground-up trabecular bone mixed in with the ground ochre. Trabecular bone is the spongy part of the inside of an animal bone. The spongy bone is rich in fat and the researchers suggest that the most likely reason the paint makers ground it up with the ochre was to supply the binder in the pro- duction of a liquid paint. Though we can’t speculate about what the paint makers intended to do with the paint, the fact that they made it at all suggests the strong possibility that they intended to paint something and, in so doing, produce art. The authors of the study admit that it is not possible to determine what the etching means, but they maintain that it is not simple doodling—though that, in and of itself, would be interesting evidence of another kind of modern human practice. They suggest that the markings follow convention; are abstract, unrelated to any real or natural images (the maker was not simply depicting something seen in nature); and may be symbolic—in other words, the markings are symbols that had a certain meaning that could have been “read” by anyone familiar with the arbitrary code on which the symbols were based. It is not surprising that human beings are capable of this. We do this all the time. What is surprising is that ancient humans may have been doing this as much as 100,000 years ago.




1. New and Improved Stone-Tool Technologies
I realize that in my discussion of stone-tool technology, I keep revisiting the les- sons learned in my experimental archaeology course where students attempt to replicate ancient stone tools. As I mentioned in Chapter 3, almost everyone is capable of making replicas of 2.4-million-year-old Oldowan choppers and flake tools. As I went on to note in Chapter 4, 1.8-million-year-old Acheulean handaxes are a bit more challenging, but some students are capable of making pretty good replicas. When it comes to the Upper Paleolithic stone-tool technol- ogies just mentioned, however, a far smaller proportion of my students become proficient at replicating the tools. Nonetheless, it is an interesting exercise, the most important lesson of which may be that the tools appear to be as much a re- flection of art as craft. Upper Paleolithic blade tools, in their graceful symmetry, appear to be the result of an attempt to make something as beautiful as it is useful. Their manufacture, therefore, is an entirely human process. Though in the previous chapter we saw that blade tools first appear in the African archaeological record about 500,000 years ago, and evidence for a blade-based stone-tool technology dates to 240,000 years ago in Kenya and 90,000 years ago in southern Africa, it wasn’t until as recently as 52,000 years ago that blade making spread into Asia and then Europe. For example, at Boker Tachtit in Israel (Marks 1990, 1993) and Ksar Akil in Lebanon (Ohnuma and Bergman 1990), the shift from Levallois technology to a stone-tool technology based on the production of elongated blades occurred by as much as 52,000 years ago at Ksar Akil and 45,000 years ago at Boker Tachtit (Figure 6.1; Marks 1993:12). South of this, in Africa, Late Stone Age sites like Haua Fteah Cave show this shift to have occurred by about 40,000 B.P. (Van Peer and Vermeersch 1990). In central and southeastern Europe, the shift from Mousterian flake to Upper Paleolithic blade production occurred before 40,000 B.P. (Svoboda 1993); in western Europe, the shift seems to have occurred a bit later, about 38,000 B.P. (Allsworth-Jones 1990). The blade technologies of the Upper Paleolithic are short-lived, and change is greatly accelerated. In western Europe, for example, the Aurignacian tradition consisted of a specific set of tools that included retouched blades, engraving tools called burins, and stone scrapers, and it is dated to between 34,000 B.P.and 27,000 B.P. From 27,000 B.P. to 21,000 B.P, the Gravettian tradition developed, with its emphasis on smaller blades and denticulate knives. The Solutrean tradition, dated from 21,000 B.P. to 16,000 B.P, is the most striking of all, characterized by finely made, bifacially flaked, symmetrical, leaf-shaped projectile points. Solutrean points are among the most finely made stone tools ever found (Figure 6.2). The Solutrean was followed by the Magdelanian, from 16,000 B.P. to 11,000 B.P, when the emphasis was not on stone tools at all but rather on bone and antler, with the attendant production of microblades. Artifacts from the various industries of the Upper Paleolithic reveal two very important facts. First, lithic technology had become more complex and elabo- rate, with a number of different manufacturing techniques that used stone more efficiently; produced more effective tools for cutting, scraping, piercing, and so on; and yielded objects far more symmetrical, balanced, and aerodynamic than those of the Middle Paleolithic. From our twenty-first-century vantage point (or, perhaps, bias), Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age industries produced tools that are more aesthetically pleasing, more artfully rendered, than those of earlier traditions. Second, and equally as important, the profusion of specific tool-tradition names points to one of the most salient differences between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic: Whereas Middle Paleolithic technology was marked by relative homogeneity temporally and geographically, Upper Paleolithic technology was characterized by an explosion of toolmaking diver- sity marked by relatively rapid change and far greater geographic variability.

2. New Hunting and Weapons Technologies
Based in part on a detailed analysis of the fracture patterns present on sharp- pointed stone tools recovered there, researchers believe that residents of Sibudu Cave, South Africa, may have developed an early version of the bow and arrow as much as 64,000 years ago (Lombard and Phillipson 2010). The bow and arrow is a complex tool whose production requires a series of inventions and skills— understanding the ability to store energy through the bending of a carefully carved piece of wood; the manufacture of a flexible, durable string to add to the stored energy and to release it suddenly; the creation of knots that can both hold tightly and be easily unhooked; and the manufacture of an aerodynamic projectile. Also in Sibudu Cave, in a level dating to more than 70,000 years ago, scien- tists discovered on some of the stone-tool bases a residue consisting of a mixture of Acacia gum, beeswax, and ochre (Wadley, Hodgskiss, and Grant 2009). In a replicative experiment, those same scientists determined that the residue was a carefully crafted adhesive intended to firmly attach stone tools to handles. As they point out, the production of the adhesive was a “multilevel” operation (p. 9593), requiring a consistent and coordinated set of procedures done in the correct order, with ingredients mixed together in proper proportions and heated to the correct temperature for a successful outcome. The spear-thrower was an innovation of the Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age. In a wonderful example of how words can move across temporal and cultural barriers, modern scholars often use the term “atlat]” instead of “spear-thrower.” Atlatl is a word in the native language of the Aztecs of Mexico (see Chapter 12). The word was picked up by the Spanish invaders of Mesoamerica, some of whom faced atlatl-using warriors, and from there entered into various European languages, including English. So we now commonly apply a sixteenth-century Aztec word for devices developed in Europe more than 30,000 years ago. The atlatl is an elongated, hooked handle that attaches to the butt of a spear and effectively increases the length of the arm of the person throwing the spear. A longer arm increases the contact time between the inception of the throw and the release, allowing for greater accuracy, speed, and distance; it works for the same reason a baseball pitcher with a long arm can often throw the ball harder and faster than can someone with a shorter pitching arm. The spear-thrower is a remarkable example of applied physics prac- ticed by ancient humans. By artificially extending the arm—and by exploiting the stored energy in the bending shaft of the dart as it is thrown—both ancient people and the Aztecs were able to dramatically increase the accuracy as well as the power with which they could launch a spear in the quest for food or in battle. Experiments have compared the force of various methods of propelling a projectile. The force of a dart thrown with a spear-thrower far exceeds that gener- ated by a hand-thrown spear, a traditional bow, or even a modern compound bow (Karl and Bruchert 1997). Spears propelled by a spear-throwing device have been clocked at more than 100 mph, and a computer-designed spear-thrower recently produced a record throw of 250 m (over 800 ft)! Spear-throwers date back to as much as 30,000 years ago. The bearers of this technology certainly had an advantage in the hunt over those who needed to get much closer to large, dangerous animals in order to successfully spear them. A 13,000-year-old spear-thrower from Enléne Cave, France, was carved from rein- deer antler (Dennell 1986). Along with being a useful tool, this spear-thrower is far more beautiful than it had to be; the handle was finely carved into the image of two ibexes (mountain goats) locked in combat (Figure 6.3). Finally, there is circumstantial evidence for another hunting technology at Sibudu Cave in South Africa. Lyn Wadley (2010) suggests that the abundance of small, forest-dwelling animals among the food remains dating there to 65,000 years ago is an indication that the residents may have developed traps and snares, as these smaller creatures would have been extremely difficult to hunt with projectiles.

3. Broadening the subsistence Base
Undeniably, the hunting of big game—megafauna—made a significant contribution to the subsistence of Upper Paleolithic people. In central and eastern Europe, for example, sites dating between 28,000 B.P. and 10,000 B.P. reflect the major role of the woolly mammoth in the subsistence base of Upper Paleolithic people. At a single site, Dolni Vestonice I, researchers have identified the remains of more than 100 mammoths butchered by the inhabitants (Soffer 1993). At this same site, butchering marks have been located on the remains of horse and rein- deer as well. The situation is much the same in Africa and western Europe, where Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age inhabitants exploited local large game animals. In Siberia, the site of Mal’ta near Irkutsk shows extensive hunting of woolly mammoth and reindeer. In South Africa, at Late Stone Age sites such as Die Kelders Cave and Eland’s Bay Cave, remains of eland (a large antelope) are abundant, and there is evidence of the hunting of the Cape buffalo, a far more dangerous animal and one avoided during the Middle Stone Age (Klein 1983). In the Upper Paleolithic of western Europe, at sites such as Abri Pataud in France, excavators found the bones of reindeer, elephant, horse, and wild cattle (R. White 1982). At Mother Grundy’s Parlour, a cave occupation site in Great Britain dating to about 12,000 B.P, the remains ofwoolly rhinoceros and mammoth, reindeer, and wild horse were found (C. Smith 1992). Also in Great Britain, Gough’s Cave shows extensive use of wild horse and red deer more than 12,200 years ago (C. Smith 1992). Following the pattern established at a few Middle Stone Age sites of ana- tomically modern humans in Africa, most notably Klasies River Mouth, Die Kelders, and Blombos Cave, the remains of fish have been found at Late Stone Age sites. The same South African sites just mentioned, for example, show evi- dence of the extensive reliance on seals, penguins, dolphins, mollusks, and flying shorebirds (Henshilwood et al. 2002; Klein 1983:43). The bones or shells of these organisms have been found, along with grooved-stone net weights used in fishing and possible early fishhooks (called “gorges”) that were baited and attached to lines. Small mammals also contributed to the food quest. At Dolni Vestonice I and at the nearby site of Pavlov,there is indirect evidence of the use of nets in hunt- ing small game (Pringle 1997). Fragments of netting made by the inhabitants of these sites, dating from between 29,000 and 22,000 years ago, had accidentally been pressed into the clay floors of the inhabitants’ houses. In a few cases, those houses burned and the impressions of the netting were preserved in the baked clay. The nets were sophisticated, indicating a probable long tradition of net weaving (Adovasio, Soffer, and Klima 1996). The netting mesh was too fine to have been used to capture large animals, but there are plenty of bones of smaller creatures, including hare and fox, at these sites. A large hare can produce 6 pounds of meat and a pelt. Driving small mammals like hares into nets is an efficient hunting technique that all members of a social group can participate in—the very young and the aged, pregnant or nursing females, and, of course, young males in their prime. It seems likely, therefore, that net hunting played a substantial role in subsistence at these and other sites that date to the same period (Pringle 1998). Plant foods also contributed to the diets of our anatomically modern human ancestors. Sarah Mason has found the burned residue of edible taproots in hearths at Dolni Vestonice I (Pringle 1998). And berries have been found in hearths at other Upper Paleolithic sites. It is highly unlikely that Upper Paleolithic people overlooked important sources of protein, carbohydrates, or vitamins available in their territories. Portrayals of ancient hunters fighting a daily duel to the death with huge, ag- gressive beasts may offer us a romantic image, but it seems an unlikely strategy for survival. It is far more likely that the people of the Upper Paleolithic subsisted on a broad spectrum of foods, including the meat from animals both large and small, birds, fish, seeds, nuts, berries, and starchy roots. Archaeological evidence is finally beginning to support this sensible reconstruction.

4. Branching Out in Raw Materials and Developing New Technologies 
We begin to see a branching out in the use of raw materials by anatomically ‘modern people in the African Middle Stone Age. In the same Middle Stone Age Layers at Blombos Cave dating to 77,000 years ago in which incised ochre rods were recovered (see the Overview of this chapter), researchers found 28 precisely crafted bone tools (Henshilwood et al. 2001; Figure 6.4). Inhabitants of the cave ‘made bone awls and apparent spearpoints in a way that implies a strict adher- ence to a sequence of steps throughout the toolmaking process. As the formal and consistent fashioning of bone tools is not seen at the sites of premodern humans, the Blombos researchers conclude that this is one indicator of the technological sophistication of the anatomically modern humans who inhabited the cave, more than 25,000 years before the inception of the Late Stone Age in Africa and the Upper Paleolithic in Europe and Asia. ‘Although the use of bone tools after 50,000 years ago may not have been absolutely innovative, the use of bone, as well as ivory, antler, and shell for the production of tools used in sewing—for example, awls, punches, and needles— and for hunting equipment—for example, spear tips—is a virtual hallmark of the Upper Paleolithic. For example, along the Dest River in Russia, Upper Paleo- lithic sites have produced slotted daggers of reindeer antler. At the Kosoutsy site in this same region, reindeer antler was also used as a raw material to manufacture spearpoints for use in the hunt, and thin slivers of reindeer bone were used in the production of eyed needles (Borziyak 1993). ‘Eyed needles allowed for more precisely tailored and sewn clothing. The pro- duction of protective outergarments that were, at least to a degree, windproof and waterproof, with seams stitched tightly through the use of such needles, would have been extremely important as people spread into colder climates, fun- damentally inhospitable to our tropically evolved and adapted ancestors. In no small measure, tight, weatherproof seams enabled by thin, eyed needles made expansion into places like the Arctic a more reasonable possibility for ancient ‘humans. Direct evidence ofthe production of tailored clothing comes from the 22,000-year-old site of Sungir’, just north of Moscow, in Russia as well as Jouclas, in France (Dennell 1986). Beads used for fastening were found in a pattern in the ground at Sungir’, outlining what appears to have been pants, shirt or jacket, a cap, and shoes (Klein 1989; R White 1993). When rock shatters on its own as a result of freezing and thawing, by skittering along in a flowing stream, or even just by gravity hurling a stone downhill into another one, it can accidently and coincidently produce sharp, sometimes useful edges. It has never seemed to ‘me that it was that big of an intellectual leap for our an- cestors to have figured out that one can take out of the equation the serendipity of natural, fortuitous breakage and, instead, intentionally shatter rock in a consistent way to make tools with specific uses in mind. It does not surprise me that our ancestors figured this out more than 2.6 million years ago. This kind of obvious experiential evidence about what happens to rocks when you smash them, however, doesn’t really apply to the development of ce- ramic technology. There simply aren’t very many natural processes an individual regularly encounters in nature in which a high temperature is accidently ap- plied to a mushy, kind of sticky dirt, producing a durable, waterproof, and largely fireproof material. There’s no obvious pathway in nature to a “eureka” moment: “Hey, I bet I can intentionally shape a vessel from that mushy, sticky dirt, put it in a fire, and make a sweet pot or bowl for myself, suitable for cooking mammoth stew, serving salsa, or whatever.” Therefore, I am deeply impressed that our ancestors had figured exactly this out as much as 20,000 years ago. A number of Upper Paleolithic figurines found in Europe (some of the so-called Venus figurines discussed later in this chapter) were made from fired clay. Perhaps, in this case, the original intention was to pro- duce a figurine from that mushy, sticky dirt and then, “oops,” it was dropped in the fire by accident, and “wow,” instead of melting or burning, which you might have expected, it maintained its shape and became hard and durable. Perhaps of even greater significance than the accidental production of ce- ramic figurines was the manufacture of pottery vessels in China, at a site in Xianrendong Cave in Jiangxi Province. There, archaeologists have found ceramic sherds representing the oldest pottery discovered anywhere in the world so far. A series of radiocarbon dates derived from organic material collected from the lowest layer in the cave in which pottery sherds were also recovered produced dates in the range of 19,000 to 20,000 years ago (Wu et al. 2012). Certainly, this is impressive as an example of branching out in the use of raw materials and in the invention of a new technology. This is also significant in terms of what pottery vessels provide: efficient, durable, easily made cooking and storage vessels. Pottery is a game changer: Clay is abundant and easily obtained; a durable, waterproof cooking pot increases the ability to extract energy from various foods, including meats and starches (Carmody, Weintraub, and Wrangham 2011); sealable storage vessels can protect foods from rodents. The Chinese evidence indicates that this happened in the Upper Paleolithic/Late Stone Age and represents another sig- nificant technological achievement of the people who lived during this period. 

5. New Uses for Plant Materials
There is evidence in Sibudu Cave for a particular kind of domestic practice using local plant material. Archaeology in the cave revealed that more than 70,000 years ago, residents lined the floor with plant material, including species that possess a nat- ural insecticide (Wadley et al. 2011). Those who visit the cave today remark on the abundant presence of mosquitos in the area, so no doubt any natural way to keep these annoying and possibly disease-carrying insects away would have been helpful. 

6. The Acquisition of Raw Materials from a Great Distance 
The ability to obtain raw materials and manufactured goods from great distances might seem to be a feature strictly of modern societies. Look around your house and try counting the goods that originated in other countries—stereo equipment and cameras manufactured in Japan, clothing made in India, and so on. When I purchased my iPhone 6 a couple of months ago, I was able to tracks its progress  from a factory in China to my house in Connecticut. It took only about three days. Amazing. ‘Whereas Middle Paleolithic people relied on raw materials whose source was close to their habitations, in the Upper Paleolithic we see far more extensive use of raw materials available only at great distances from living sites. For example, at the Kostenki-Borshevo sites in Russia, inhabitants used local lithic materials (quartzite and brown and yellow flint) in making stone tools. Also used, how- ever, was a black flint that possessed superior chipping qualities (it chipped more regularly) but was not available in the Kostenki-Borshevo region. Trace element analysis (see Chapter 2) of the raw materials recovered at the site suggests that the flint obtained by the inhabitants of the Kostenki-Borshevo region for their artifacts actually came from a source 300 km (186 mi) distant (Klein 1969:227). The situation is much the same throughout the geographic extent of Upper Paleolithic cultures. For example, in Moravia, in south-central Europe, flint com- monly was moved across distances of 100 km (62 mi) from its source (Oliva 1993:52). In rare instances, apparently highly valued material like obsidian (volcanic glass) from Hungary is found in Paleolithic sites up to 500 km (310 mi) away (Oliva 1993:52). Even where quite serviceable stone was available locally, material obtain- able only from great distances was often used. Archaeologist Martin Oliva (1993) suggests that maintaining long-distance contacts through trade seems to have been more important than the specific qualities of the lithics themselves and that the stone and its trade took on more of a ritual meaning than just a utilitarian signifi- cance. The use of raw materials from great distances away by Upper Paleolithic peo- ples implies a greater reliance on trade with distant groups and perhaps also implies broader social networks (hypothetically maintained by seasonal get-togethers evi- denced at the aggregation sites) than anything seen in Middle Paleolithic contexts. 

7. Larger Sites of Population Aggregation 
Middle Paleolithic sites tend to be small, representative of the encampments of no- madic, opportunistic foragers, who took whatever resources they could wher- ever they became available, without much planning in advance (Binford 1984). Though Upper Paleolithic sites include similarly small foraging camps, much larger sites also date to the Upper Paleolithic. Randall White (1982) interprets these as places of aggregation, localities where numerous small bands of people would come together seasonally. The site of Mal'ta, in Siberia, for example, covers an area of some 600 m? (about 6,500 ft?; Chard 1974:20); it includes the remains of numer- ous dwellings whose frames were made from the large bones of woolly mammoth (Figure 6.5). This size is far larger than that of the standard Middle Paleolithic site. The settlement pattern of the Middle Paleolithic with its complement of small sites scattered across the landscape would seem to reflect a strategy of opportunistic foraging, where people followed resources wherever they might become available. The pattern of subsistence in the Upper Paleolithic appears to be different, at least in part, as reflected by the existence of large sites where popu- lations came together during a yearly cycle. People still lived in nomadic bands, but the movement of the band was no longer unrestricted, instead following a fixed yearly pattern where at least some seasonally occupied sites were returned to each year, perhaps by members of several bands.


During the Upper Paleolithic, therefore, the settlement pattern seems to indicate a shift to a fixed seasonal round as part of a strategy of logistical collecting (Binford 1984). Subsistence and movements were planned out in advance as people gained a detailed knowledge of their territory, seasonality, and the behavior and shifting locations of the plants and animals on which they subsisted. Some sites were continually visited by aggregations of related people during fixed and known times of the year when resources may have been particularly abundant at these places—for example, at a topographic bottleneck on a migra- tion route for large animals. Some of these sites, perhaps, became ritually sancti- fied through the use of artwork to denote the significance of a particular place to the members of the group. This possibility is discussed in the section on the appearance of artwork in the Upper Paleolithic and in “Issues and Debates.” 

8. Abundance of Nonutilitarian Objects
In my classes I see many students, men and women, wearing nonutilitarian items of personal adornment: necklaces, earrings, nose rings, tongue piercings, ear cufls, gauges, finger rings, bracelets, anklets, hairpins. Some have gold and silver drap- ing every extremity and dangling from a multitude of pierced body parts some of which I'd rather not think about. All our bodies look basically the same, built along one of two fundamental models: male or female. But we have invented nu- merous ways of decorating ourselves—defining, identifying, and distinguishing ourselves—with objects of adornment. Artifacts interpretable as items of personal adornment are rare at the sites of premodern humans. The Neandertal site of Arcy-sur-Cure is one of the very few places where multiple objects of personal adornment have been found associated with premoderns (see Figure 5.11). For the most part, stone, bone, antler, shell, or ivory jewelry is restricted to the sites of anatomically modern human beings. One of the oldest sites where such items of adornment have been found is the Grotte des Pigeons in Morocco, in northwestern Africa. Excavators recovered thirteen perforated mollusk shell ornaments there in a cave level dated to 82,000 years ago (Bower 2007). The perforations appear to have been made intentionally, and wear along the margins of the perforations likely resulted when the shells rubbed against a cord from which they likely were suspended. The same kind of perforated shells have been found in greater numbers at the previously mentioned Blombos Cave in South Africa. There, dating to 75,000 years ago in the same stratigraphic level in which the red ochre mentioned on page 188 was recovered, researchers have found 41 perforated mollusk shell beads (Henshilwood et al. 2004). The perforation appears at the same spot on 36 of the shells—on the back near the lip (Figure 6.6). As was true in the case of the Moroc- can artifacts, the location of the holes in the Blombos shells is rarely seen in nature and clearly seems to have been intentional, perhaps to hang the beads in a necklace. The Grotte des Pigeons and Blombos Cave beads date to the African Middle Stone Age, but it is in the Late Stone Age and Upper Paleolithic when there appears to be an explosion in the production of items of personal adornment and other no- nutilitarian objects. For example, a handful of 40,000-year-old sites in Africa, west Asia, and Europe have produced shell beads or perforated teeth, likely intended to be suspended from a necklace. Dating to 15,000 B.P, Malta, in central Asia (Chard 1974), has produced a wealth of items of adornment. A small child was found buried at Mal’ta with a neck- lace made of bone and antler beads (Figure 6.7). Also found were schematic carvings of birds, a carved bone plaque with designs consisting of dots and wavy lines etched or punched into the surface of the bone, and depictions of human beings (Figure 6.8). As Randall White (1982) points out, the appear- ance of items of personal adornment that were often painstakingly made, frequently out of exotic material that must have been difficult to obtain—and there- fore “expensive” in terms of time and effort to obtain it—is significant. In Whites view, such objects imply increasing awareness and importance of individual identity in Upper Paleolithic society. Whatever the specific significance of the development of items of personal adornment, it seems clear that people in the Upper Paleolithic were much like ourselves.

9. More Elaborate Burials
Whatever your philosophy or religion, the death of a loved one or the contemplation of one’s own mortal- ity is pretty momentous stuff. How we dispose of and memorialize our dead is a reflection of how we view death, and the archaeological record has much to tell us about how our ancestors dealt with the end of life. If the modern folktale is true, a woman in California (sometimes the story has it in Florida) was buried in a nightgown, seated at the wheel of her brand new Jaguar (or Porsche, take your pick). Thats certainly making a statement. More commonly, married people may be buried wearing their wedding bands. Devout Christians may be interred with a cross around their neck. Burying the dead with treasured personal items is a long-standing human tra- dition. Egyptian pharaohs were buried with food, jewelry, furniture—even other people (see Chapter 10). The emperors of imperial China were buried with char- iots and entire life-size ceramic armies of soldiers and horses (see Chapter 11). We see this pattern repeated over and over. Whether because it is believed that the deceased will need such items in the afterlife or simply because of the desire to place some items of personal identification with a departed friend, the practice of burying the dead with objects that were meaningful to them and their loved ones seems nearly universal. See the “Case Study Close-up” in this chapter for an example of elaborate ritual burials in the Upper Paleolithic.

10. Symbolic Expression Through the Production of Art
  
Artistic expression by early humans dates back approximately 164,000 years, as evidenced by findings at Pinnacle Cave on South Africa's Cape coast. Researchers there discovered worn pieces of red ochre, a soft iron oxide mineral that varies in color from nearly black to shades of red and orange. Typically, ochre is ground into a powder and mixed with binders like animal fat, egg whites, or saliva to create paint. The wear on these ochre fragments suggests they might have been used either in tool-making adhesives or for body decoration, as is done by modern humans.

Further evidence of early human artistry comes from Blombos Cave, also in South Africa, which lacks natural ochre deposits. Archaeologists have uncovered over 8,000 pieces of ochre there, including 13 fragments dating back around 100,000 years that feature deliberate incisions, such as parallel lines, fan-shaped etchings, and wavy lines. Additionally, around 77,000 years ago, larger ochre pieces with crosshatched and parallel incised lines were found, indicating sophisticated use of design.

A remarkable discovery at Blombos Cave includes two ochre-based paint-making stations estimated to be 101,000 years old. These stations comprised abalone shells used as mixing bowls and quartzite stones for grinding, nestled perfectly within the shells. The interior of these shells bore signs of scraping, and traces of trabecular bone—a spongy bone rich in fat—were found mixed with the ochre, likely serving as a binder for creating liquid paint. While the exact purpose of the paint remains speculative, the complexity of its production points to a likely artistic endeavor.

The etchings on the ochre do not represent natural or real images but follow a stylized, abstract pattern that might have been symbolic, suggesting these markings could have been understood within a shared cultural framework. This indicates that even 100,000 years ago, early humans were capable of creating symbols with shared meanings, a practice that is a hallmark of modern human behavior.
