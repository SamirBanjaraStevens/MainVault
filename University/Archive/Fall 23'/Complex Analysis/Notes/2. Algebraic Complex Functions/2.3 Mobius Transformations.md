#### Definition 2.2

Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{C}$,
	such that $ad-bc \ne 0$ 
The rational transformation
$$f(z) = f_{a, b, c, d}(z) = \cfrac{az+b}{cz+d}$$
is called the *Mobius Transformation*
***
If $c=0$, then $a, d \ne 0$ and the function is a polynomial function with a zero multiplicity of $1$ at $z_{0}=-\cfrac{b}{a}$
the domain of $f$ is the entire $\mathbb{C}$ and $f: \mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ is a *bijection*
We extend $f$ to a bijection $\hat{f} : \hat{\mathbb{C}} \to \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ by:
$$
\hat{f}(z) =
\left\{ 
\begin{align}
&f(z)  = \cfrac{ax+b}{d}  \quad &, \text{ if } z \in \mathbb{C} \\
&\infty    \quad &, \text{ if } z = \infty
\end{align}
\right.
$$
***
The transformation,
$$
\begin{align}
f(z) &= \cfrac{az+b}{d} \\
&= \cfrac{a}{d}z + \cfrac{b}{d} \\
&= \cfrac{a}{d}(z + \cfrac{b}{a})
\end{align}
$$
is a composition 
	of the **rescaling** *(rotation + homothety)* 
		$z \mapsto \cfrac{a}{d}z$, 
	followed by the **translation** 
		$z \mapsto z + \cfrac{b}{d}$

It is also a composition
	of the translation
		$z \mapsto z + \frac{b}{a}$ 
	followed by the rescaling 
		$z \mapsto \cfrac{a}{d}z$
***
If $c \ne 0$
	then the function $f$ is a rational function 
		with a pole of order $1$ at $z_{0}=-\cfrac{d}{c}$
The domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{C} \textbackslash \left\{   -\cfrac{d}{c}\right\}$ 
	and the image of $f$ is $\mathbb{C} \textbackslash \left\{ \cfrac{a}{c} \right\}$ 
Then,
$$
f : \mathbb{C} \ \textbackslash \left\{ -\cfrac{d}{c} \right\} \to \mathbb{C} \ \textbackslash \left\{ \cfrac{a}{c} \right\} 
$$ is a bijection; 
we extend $f$ to a bijection $\hat{f} : \hat{\mathbb{C}} \to \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ by
$$
\hat{f}(z) = 
\left\{ 
\begin{align}
&f(z) = \cfrac{az+b}{cz+d},  &\text{ if } z &\in \mathbb{C} \textbackslash \left\{- \cfrac{d}{c} \right\}  \\
&\infty,  &\text{ if } z &= -\cfrac{d}{c}\\
&\cfrac{a}{c},  &\text{ if } z &= \infty
\end{align}
\right.
$$
The transformation $f$ 
$$
f(z) = \cfrac{a}{c} + \cfrac{bc-ad}{c^{2}} \cdot \cfrac{1}{z+\cfrac{d}{c}}
$$
is a composition of 
	the translation 
		$z \mapsto z+\cfrac{d}{c}$, 
		followed by the inversion
			 $z \mapsto \cfrac{1}{z}$ 
				then by the rescaling 
					$z \mapsto \cfrac{bc-ad}{c^{2}}\cdot z$ 
						and then\, finally by the translation 
							$z \mapsto z + \cfrac{a}{c}$ 
***
**Bottom line:**
Mobius transformations are compositions 
	of translations, 
		rotations,
			homotheties
				and inversions.

The composition of two Mobius transformations is also a Mobius transformation and the inverse of a Mobius transformation is also a Mobius transformation.
	*In the language of abstract algebra,*
		the composition of functions $\hat{\mathbb{C}} \to \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ endows the set of Mobius transformations with a group structure.
***
Translations, rotations, hometheties, and inversions,
	*preserve cross-rations*, 
		hence **Mobius transformations transformations** *preserve cross-rations*
				(a property that can also be checked directly from the definition)
As a consequence, Mobius transformations send extended circles to extended circles.
***
A Mobius transformation seems to depend on four parameters,
	$a, b, c, d \in\mathbb{C}$; however, if $\lambda\ne 0$ is a nonzero complex number,
		then,
$$
\begin{align}
f_{\lambda a, \lambda b, \lambda c, \lambda d} (z) &=
\cfrac{az+\lambda b}{\lambda cz + \lambda d} \\
&= \cfrac{az+b}{ccz+d} \\
&= f_{a, b, c, d}(z)
\end{align}
$$
hence the tuples $(\lambda a, \lambda b, \lambda c, \lambda d)$ and $(a, b, c, d)$ 
	define the same Mobius transformations.
By rescaling we can assume that $ad-bc = 1$
The moral of this observation is that we need only three more conditions, 
	given by the values of the function at three distinct points.

### Theorem 2.2
Given two triples $(z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3})$ and $(w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3})$ =, each consisting of distinct elements of $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, 
	there exists a unique Mobius transformation $f: \hat{\mathbb{C}} \to \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ 
		such that $f(z_{1}) = w_{1}, f(z_{2}) = w_{2}, \text{ and } f(z_{3})= w_{3}$, 

**Proof:**
