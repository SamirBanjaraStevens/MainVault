If $n$ is an integer, then the power operation $z \to z^{n}$ is clear;
	it is defined on all $\mathbb{C}$ is $n > 0$, 
		and only on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ if $n\leq 0$ 

**In this section we define the power operation $z \to z^{a}$ for rational exponents $a = \cfrac{m}{n}$** 
***
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states 
	that every non-constant polynomial 
		with complex coefficients has 
			at least one complex root. 

What could be a root of the polynomial $X^{4}+1$?
***
We can factor $X^{4}+1 = (X^{2}+i)(X^{2}-i)$
	so we need a complex number $z$ 
		such a value would be a square root,
				or the number raised to the power $\frac{1}{2}$  
But what do $i^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $(-i)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ mean?
More generally, 
	Given a complex number $z$ and a rational number $\frac{m}{n}$ 
		What would be a meaningful definition of $z^{\frac{m}{n}}$ 
Expand from the case of positive reals,
	where $x^{\frac{m}{n}} = (x^{m})^{\frac{1}{n}}$, 
		the value $z^{\frac{m}{n}}$ could mean either:

A.) A complex value $\zeta$ such that $\zeta^{n}=z^{m}$,or
b.) A complex value $\zeta^{m}$ where $\zeta^{m} = z$ 
***
We therefore start with the special case $m=1$, 
	hence powers with rational exponents $a=\cfrac{1}{n}$, 
		reciprocals of integers.
***
If $z$ is complex number and $n$ is a nonzero integer, 
	then we would want $\zeta = z^{\frac{1}{n}}$ to be a complex number 
		with the property that $\zeta^{n} = z$
If $z = 0$, 
	then for a positive integer $n$ 
		the only solution of $\zeta^{n} = 0$ 
			is $\zeta = 0$
and, for a negative integer $n$
	the equation $\zeta^{n} = 0$ does not have any solutions in $\mathbb{C}$
***
We assume henceforth that $z \ne 0$ 
Since $\zeta^{n} = z$ is equivalent to $\zeta^{-n} = z^{-1}$
	it suffices to focus on the case 
		where $n>0$ is a positive integer;
we start with a concrete example.

###### Example 2.6
Let $z = 1$ and $n=5$;
	we want to find the complex numbers $\zeta$ 
		such that $\zeta^{5} = 1$
Since de Moivre's formula $(1.4)$ provides a nice way of 
	computing powers of complex numbers in trigonometric form,
		we will work with trigonometric forms of complex numbers.
We therefore look for $\zeta = \rho(\cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha)$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
1 &= \cos 0 + i \sin 0 \\
&= \left( \rho \left( \cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha \right) \right)^{5} \\
&= \rho^{5} (\cos(5 \alpha) + i \sin (5 \alpha))\\ 
\end{align}
$$
Equating the *moduli* and the argument sets we obtain
$$
\rho^{5} = 1 \quad \text{ and } \quad 5\alpha = 2k\pi, \text{ for some } k \in\mathbb{Z}
$$
from which we conclude that 
$$
\rho = 1 \quad
\text{ and } \quad
\alpha = \cfrac{2k\pi}{5},\quad
\text{ for some } k \in\mathbb{Z}
$$
***
The modulus is therefore equal to $1$ for all solutions of $\zeta^{5} = 1$
Different values $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ 
    will result in the same value for $\zeta$ 
	    if and only if the corresponding values of $\alpha$ differ by an integer multiple of $2\pi$
and that is the case if and only if $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ differ by a multiple of $5$
As a consequence,
	there are exactly five different value for $\zeta$,
		corresponding to $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$
The solutions of $\zeta^{5}$ are therefore give by 
$$
\begin{align}
\zeta^{0} & = \cos 0 + i  \sin 0 & = 1\\
\zeta^{1} & = \cos \cfrac{2\pi}{5} + i \sin \cfrac{2\pi}{5} &= \omega^{1} \\
\zeta^{2} & = \cos \cfrac{4\pi}{5} + i \sin \cfrac{4\pi}{5} &= \omega^{2} \\
\zeta^{3} & = \cos \cfrac{6\pi}{5} + i \sin \cfrac{6\pi}{5} &= \omega^{3}\\
\zeta^{4} & =\cos \cfrac{8\pi}{5} + i \sin \cfrac{8\pi}{5} &= \omega^{4}
\end{align}
$$
