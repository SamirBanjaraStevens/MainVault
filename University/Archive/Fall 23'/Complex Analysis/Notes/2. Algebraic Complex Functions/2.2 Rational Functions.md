A *rational function* is a quotient of two polynomial functions: 
$$f(z) = \cfrac{P(z)}{Q(z)}$$
If $z_{0}$ is a zero of $Q$ of multiplicity $m_{Q}$ 
	and a zero of $P$ of multiplicity $m_{P}$
Then 
$$
\begin{align}
P(z) &= (z-z_{0})^{m_{P}}P_{1(z)}\\
Q(z) &= (z-z_{0})^{m_{Q}}Q_{1(z)}\\
f(z) &= \cfrac{(z-z_{0})^{m_{P}}P_{1}(z)}{(z-z_{0})^{m_{Q}}Q_{1}(z)} \\
&= (z-z_{0})^{m_{P}-m_{Q}}\cfrac{P_{1}(z)}{Q_{1}(z)}
\end{align}
$$
Since $P_{1}(z_{0}) \ne 0 \ne Q_{1}(z_{0})$ 
	it follows that, 
		after simplifying the common powers of $z-z_{0}$ from $P$ and $Q$ 
			the function $f$ can be defined at $z_{0}$ if and only if $m_{P} \geq m_{Q}$ 
***
Let $f(z) = \cfrac{P(z)}{Q(z)}$ be a rational function, such that $P$ and $Q$ do not have any common zeros.
A zero $z_{0}$ of $Q$ is called a *pole* of $f$. 
The Multiplicity of $z_{0}$ of $Q$ is called the *order* of the pole $z_{0}$ of $f$. 
The domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{C}$ minus all the poles - the entire plane with a finite number of points removed.
