A **Polynomial** is an infinite sequence of complex numbers,
$$P=(a_{0}, a_{1}, \dots)$$ with the property that only finitely many of the terms are not equal to zero. 

If $a_{n} \ne 0$ and $a_{j}=0$ for all $j > n$ 
	then, we represent $P$ using an indeterminate $X$ as
$$P = a_{0} + a_{1}X+ a_{2}X^{2}+\dots+a_{n}X^{n}$$
we call the $n$ the *degree* of the polynomial P.
***
If $a_{j}=0$ for all $j=0,1,\dots,$ then we say that $P$ is the *zero polynomial* and do not associate a degree to it.
The numbers $a_{0}, a_{1},\dots, a_{n}$ are called the *coefficIents* of the polynomial $P$. 
The term $a_{k}X^{k}$ is the *term of degree $k$* in $P$
***
The set of all polynomials with the complex coefficients is denoted by $\mathbb{C}[X]$;
	for the real coefficients, 
		the notation is $\mathbb{R}[X]$ 
For a polynomial $P$,
	we define the *polynomial function* $f_{P}: \mathbb{C} \to C$ 
$$f_{P}(z) = a_{0}+a_{1}z+a_{2}z^{2}+\dots+a_{n}z^{n}$$
***
Polynomial functions are defined for all values $z \in\mathbb{C}$, hence the domain of $f_{P}$ is the entire complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ 

Two polynomial functions are equal if an only if the underlying polynomials are equal; by a slight abuse of language we will use $P$ both for the polynomial $P$ and the associated polynomial function $f_{P}$ and refer to the polynomial function as the *polynomial*
$$P(z) = a_{0}+a_{1}z+a_{2}z^{2}+\dots+a_{n}z^{n}$$
***
A complex number $z_{0}$ is a *root* of a polynomial $P$ if the polynomial $P$ evaluated for $z=z_{0}$ is equal to zero: $P(z_{0})=0$. If that condition is satisfied , we will also call $z_{0}$ a *zero* of the polynomial $P$.
***
If $z_{0}$ is a zero of a polynomial $P$ of degree $n>0$, then there exists a polynomial $Q$ of degree $n-1$ such that $P(z)=(z-z_{0})Q(z)$. 
The largest positive integer $m$ such that $P(z)=(z-z_{0})^{m}q(z)$ for a polynomial $Q$ is called the *multiplicity* of $z_{0}$ as a zero of $P$. If $z_{0}$ is a zero of multiplicity $m$ of $P$ and $P(z)=(z-z_{0})^{m}Q(z)$, then $Q(z_{0})\ne 0$
***
Complex numbers were introduced in order to solve a very specific problem: find a zero of the polynomial $P(X)=1+X^{2}$.

## Theorem 2.1
(Fundamental Theorem Of Algebra)

If $P$ is any nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients, then $P$ has a zero in $\mathbb{C}$. 

The following is a consequence of this reasult.

### Corollary 1
If $P \in\mathbb{C}[X]$ is a polynomial of degree $n > 0$ with complex coefficients, then $P$ has exactly $n$ zeros (counted with their multiplicities).

Therefore, any polynomial $P \in\mathbb{C}[X]$ can be factored as a product of (possibly repeated) term of degree one.
$$P(X)=a(X-z_{1})^{m_{1}}(x-z_{2})^{m_{2}} \dots (X-z_{k})^{m_{k}} $$
the zeros/ roots of $P$ are $z_{1}, z_{2}, \dots, z_{k}$ with multiplicities $m_{1}, m_{2}, \dots, m_{k}$, respectively. 
The sum of the multiplicities is the degree of $P$:
$$m_{1}+m_{2}+\dots+m_{k}=\text{deg} \ P$$
