## Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication

Algebraic operations on complex numbers are formally defined using their representations as pairs of real numbers.

Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are defined as component-wise operations:
$$(a, b) \pm (c, d) = (a \pm b, c \pm d)$$
which we will write as 
$$(a + bi) + (c+di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$$
$$(a + bi) + (c+di) = (a + c) - (b + d)i$$

Multiplications of complex numbers as may look puzzling at first, as it is formally defined as:
$$(a, b) \cdot (c, d) = (ac-bd, ad+bc)$$
Why that way to multiply complex numbers?
Think of $(a, b) = a + bi$ as the polynomial $a + bX$ and then about multiplying $(a + bi)(c+di)$ as polynomials:
$$(a+bX)(c+ dX) = ac + (ad + bc)X + bdX^2$$
Now replace $X = i$ and $X^{2} = i^{2} = -1$ to get
$$(a+bi)(c+di)=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i$$
That motivates the formula for multiplying complex numbers.

## Inverse and Division

For nonzero real number $x$, 
	there exists a unique and real number, 
		denoted by $\frac{1}{x}$ or $x^{-1}$ such that $x \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 1$
Does that extend to complex numbers?
Let $z = a +bi$ to be a complex number;
	we would like to find a complex number $w = x +iy$ such that $zw = 1$
Writing down the product of $zw$ on components and equating the real and imaginary parts of $zw = (a+bi)(c+di)$ and $1$, we get the linear system
$$
\left\{  \begin{align}
ax - by & = 11 \\
bx + ay &= 0
\end{align} \right.
