wj3u3The set $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers is an extension of the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers.
Motivated by the fact that, within $\mathbb{R}$, there are polynomials equations without solutions:
	For example, $x^{2}+1=0$
Therefore we need to extend the set of real numbers by adding a non-real number, $i$, such that, in a sense still to be defined, $i^2+1=0$ 
We have made the very first step about extending the algebraic operations from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{C}$: we want the product $i \cdot i$ to be equal to the real number $-1$.

### **Algebraic Form of a Complex Number**

The next step is to include real multiples of $i$, and sums of real numbers and real multiples of $i$. That leads to the set $\mathbb{C}$ consisting of (abstract so far) quantities of the form $a+bi$ with $a, b \in\mathbb{R}$ 
$$\tag{1.1} \mathbb{C} = \{ a + bi \ | \ a,b \in\mathbb{R}\}$$ This set can be identified with the set $\mathbb{R}^{2}=\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ of pairs $(a, b)$ of real numbers, 
	the abstract quantity $z = a+b i \in \mathbb{C}$ being uniquely represented by the pair $(a,b) \in\mathbb{R}^{2}$ 
We will call $a$ 
	the *real part* 
		of $z = a+b i$ 
& we will call $b$
	the *imaginary part* 
		of $z = a + b i$ 
***
The representation 
$$
\begin{align}
z &= a +bi \\
&= \text{Re }z + i \text{ Im}
\end{align}
$$
	is the *algebraic form of $z$*, or the *rectangular form* of $z$
***
A real number $x$ is represented by $x=x+0i = (x, 0)$ 
	so, the set of complex numbers does include the set of real numbers.

The new number $i$,
	which we will call the *imaginary unit*, is represented by $0+1\cdot i = (0, 1)$ 
The complex plane is also referred to as the *Argand plane*, where the axis are denoted by $\text{Re}$ and $\text{Im}$ instead of $x$ and $y$.


### Trigonometric Form of a Complex Number.

Representing a complex number as $z = a + b i$, 
	with $a, b$ real numbers, uses the rectangular coordinate system on the plane $\mathbb{R}^{2} \approx \mathbb{C}$ 
An Alternative representation uses the polar coordinate system $(r, \theta)$, where $r$ is the Euclidean distance from $z$ to the origin $0$, 
and for $r < 0, \theta$ is the angle between the horizontal axis and the half-line $0z$, measured in a counter-clockwise direction.
Then,
$$a = r\cos \theta, \quad b = r \sin \theta$$ and hence,
$$z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$$
the representation above is called the *trigonometric form* of $z$,
	or the *polar form*
***
For a given complex number $z = a + b i$,
	the number $r$ is uniquely determined, 
		and is called the *Modulus* of $z$
			denoted by $|z|$:
				$$|z| = r = \sqrt{ a^{2}+b^{2} }$$
For $r=0$ the angle $\theta$ is not defined at all,
	and for $r > 0$,
		the angle satisfies the conditions 
			$$\cos \theta = \cfrac{a}{r} \quad \sin \theta.  = \cfrac{b}{r}$$

Since $\cos(\theta + 2k \pi) = \cos \theta$
	and $\sin(\theta + 2k\pi) = \sin \theta$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
		the conditions on $\cos \theta$ and $\sin \theta$ above 
			determine $\theta$ only up to an integer multiple of $2\pi$
	We define the *argument* set of $z$ to be the set of all possible values of $\theta$:
$$
\text{arg } z = \left \{ \theta \in\mathbb{R} \ | \ \cos \theta = \cfrac{a}{r} \quad \sin \theta = \cfrac{b}{r}\right\} 
$$
An element of the argument set of $z$ is called *an argument* of $z$ and we have,
$$z = |z| (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$$ for all $\theta \in \text{ arg }z$
***
### Branches of the Argument

One of the main complications that we will encounter is the impossibility of choosing a preferred value from $\text{arg }z$ that depends on continuously on $z$:
	Intuitively, if we start at z = 1 (with theta = 0) 
		and move counter-clockwise around the circle $|z| = 1$,
			a continuous choice from $\text{arg } z$ will increase continuously,
				reaching $\theta = \cfrac{\pi}{2}$ at $z = i$,
					then $\theta = \pi$ at $z = -1$, followed by $\theta = \cfrac{3\pi}{2}$ at $z=-i$,
		The problem appears when we try to close the circle and get back $z = 1$,
			as the continuous choice will push $\theta$ towards $2\pi$,
				while the value at $z=1$ is $\theta = 0$
***
There are ways to make consistent choices from $\text{arg } z$, 
	but the results will have jumps as above.
For every angle $\alpha \in\mathbb{R}$, 
	there is only one value of $\theta \in \text{arg }z$ 
		in the interval $(\alpha, \alpha +2\pi]$ 
	And, that value defines a function called  *the $\alpha$-branch of the argument* of $z$:
$$\tag{1.2}\text{arg }_{\alpha} : \mathbb{C} \setminus\{0\} \to (\alpha, \alpha + 2 \pi)$$ $$\text{arg }_{\alpha}(z) = \left\{ \theta \in (\alpha, \alpha + 2\pi] \ | \ \cos \theta = \cfrac{a}{r}, \ \sin \theta = \cfrac{b}{r}\right\}$$
In particular, for $\alpha = -\pi$, 
	the corresponding branch is called *the main branch*
		and is denoted by $\text{Arg } : \mathbb{C} \setminus \{ 0 \} \to (-\pi, \pi]$ 
$$
\tag{1.3}
\text{Arg }(z) = \text{arg}_{-\pi} (z) = \left \{  \theta \in (-\pi, \pi] \ | \ \cos \theta = \cfrac{a}{r}, \ \sin \theta = \cfrac{b}{r} \right\} 
$$
The main branch of the argument is also called *the principal value of the argument*
***

If $z= x + i y$, then for $z \neq 0$
$$
\text{Arg}(z) =  
\left \{ \begin{aligned}
& \arccos \cfrac{x}{\sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2} }}, \quad &\text{if } y\geq 0\\
& -\arccos \cfrac{x}{\sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2} }}, \quad &\text{if } y < 
\end{aligned} \right. \quad\quad = sgn(y)\arccos \cfrac{x}{\sqrt{ x^{2}+y^{2} }},
$$
where $\arccos$: $\mathbb{R} \to [0, \pi]$ is an inverse of the $\cos$ function, and $\text{sgn}$ is defined as $\text{sgn }(y) = 1$ for $y\geq 0$ and $\text{sgn }(y) = -1$ for $y < {0}$
