## Power with Real Exponents

In the previous module 
	we learned how to define rational powers of complex numbers, 
		and noticed the limitations of that definition. 
But how about *irrational* powers?
For example, 
	What would be a reasonable way to define $i^{\sqrt{ 3 }}$?
***
One idea is to use rational approximations of $\sqrt{ 3 }$
	to compute those rational powers,
		with the expectation that
			the resulting values cluster around a specific value, 
				which we will than take as the definition of $i^{\sqrt{ 3 }}$ 
Let $(r_{n})_{n}$ be a sequence of rational numbers converging to $\sqrt{ 3 }$ and let
$$
\begin{align}
z_{n}&=i^{r_{n}}\\
&=\left|\, i^{r_{n}} \,\right| (\cos(r_{n}\mathrm{Arg}(i))+i \sin (r_{n} \mathrm{Arg}(i)))\\
&= \cos \left( \cfrac{\pi r_{n}}{2} \right)+i \sin \left( \cfrac{\pi r_{n}}{2} \right) 
\end{align}
$$
Since, 
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{ n \to \infty } \cfrac{\pi r_{n}}{2} &= \cfrac{\pi}{2}\lim_{ n \to \infty } r_{n} \\
&=\cfrac{\pi}{2} \cdot \sqrt{ 3 } \\
&= \cfrac{\pi \sqrt{ 3 }}{2}
\end{align}
$$
we expect that, as we take larger and larger values for $n$, the values of $z_{n}$ will get closer, and stay closer, to the complex number,
$$
Z = 
\cos \left( \cfrac{\pi \sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right) + i \sin \left( \cfrac{\pi \sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right)
$$
Indeed, the *Mean Value Theorem* for the real functions $\cos$ and $\sin$ imply the inequalities 
$$
\begin{align}
\left|\,\cos x-\cos y  \,\right| &\leq \left|\, x-y \,\right|,   \\
\left|\, \sin x - \sin y \,\right| &\leq \left|\, x-y \,\right|  
\end{align}
$$
using those inequalities we conclude that 
$$\left|\, z_{n}-Z \,\right| \leq \cfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{ 2 }} \left|\, r_{n}-\sqrt{ 3 } \,\right| $$
***
Since the sequence of rational (real) numbers $(r_{n})_{n}$ converges to $\sqrt{ 3 }$ 
	its value eventually get and stay arbitrarily close to $\sqrt{ 3 }$ 
		and therefore the values of $z_{n}$ eventually get and stay close to $Z$ 
It is reasonable then to define,
$$i^{\sqrt{ 3 }} = \cos \left( \cfrac{\pi \sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right) + i \sin \left( \cfrac{\pi \sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right) $$
more generally, for a nonzero complex number $z$ and a real number $t$ we define 
$$
\tag{3.1} 
z^{t} = \left|\, z \,\right|^{t} \left( \cos \left( t \mathrm{Arg}(z) \right) + i \sin \left( t \mathrm{Arg}(z) \right)  \right) 
$$
The limitations of this choice are similar to those for rational exponents, hence extra care is needed when operating with non-integer powers of complex numbers.

## Sequences of Complex Numbers

The discussion above extends concepts related to long-term behavior of sequence of real numbers to the complex universe.
And in the rest of this section we formalize that extension. 

A *sequence* of complex numbers is a infinite ordered list
$$(z_{n})_{n\geq 1} = (z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, \dots)$$
of complex numbers;
	the elements are indexed by the elements $1, 2, 3, \dots$ of the set $\mathbb{N} = \{ 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$ of naturals numbers.
***
Here are a few examples, 
$$((i\pi)^{n})_{n\leq 1}, \quad \left( \cfrac{1-i^{n}}{1-i} \right)_{n\geq 1}, \quad \left( \left( 1+\cfrac{i\pi}{n} \right)^{n} \right)_{n\geq 1}$$
The first five terms of the first sequence,
	obtained by giving $n$ the values $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ 
		are shown below:
$$
\begin{align}
(i\pi)^{1}&=i\pi \\
(i\pi)^{2}&=-\pi^{2} \\
(i\pi)^{3}&=-i\pi^{3} \\
(i\pi)^{4}&=\pi^{4} \\
(i\pi)^{5}&=i\pi^{5}
\end{align}
$$
***
Sometimes we may want to start indexing not from 1 but from a different integer $k$, (then writing $(z_{n})_{n\geq k}$) and also allowing negative integers as indices, and maybe even go backwards with the indices towards $-\infty$, as in $(z_{n})_{n\leq k}$
***
Since a complex number $z = x + iy$ 
	is a pair $(x, y)$ of real numbers $x$ and $y$,
		a sequence $(z_{n})_{n}$ of complex numbers 
			is essentially a pair $((z_{n})_{n}, (y_{n})_{n})$ 
				of sequence of real numbers, 
					with $z_{n}=x_{n}+iy_{n}$ for every value of the index $n$
Properties of sequence of real numbers have natural extensions to sequence of complex numbers, with one notable exception:
	as the set $\mathbb{C}$ does not have a canonical ordering, 
		the concept of a monotone (increasing, decreasing) sequence does not apply to sequence of complex numbers. 
#### Definition 3.1

A sequence $(z_{n})_{n}$ of complex numbers is *bounded* 
	if there exists a real number $M$ such that $\left|\, z_{n} \,\right| < M$ for all $n$

A sequence that is **non bounded** is *unbounded*
***
The sequence $(z_{n} = x_{n} + iy_{n})_{n}$ is bounded if and only if both sequences of real numbers $(x_{n})_{n}$ and $(y_{n})_{n}$ are bounded; the equivalence follows from the inequalities
$$
|x_{n}|, |y_{n}| \leq \mathrm{max}(|x_{n}|, |y_{n}|) \leq |z_{n}| = \sqrt{ |x_{n}|^{2}+|y_{n}|^{2} } \leq |x_{n}| + |y_{n}|
$$
The sequence $(z_{n}=x_{n}+iy_{n})$ is unbounded if and only if one of the sequence $(x_{n})_{n}$ or $(y_{n})_{n}$

## Limit of Sequences

The notion of limit extends from sequences of real numbers to sequences of complex numbers:
a complex number $Z$ is a limit of a sequence of complex numbers $(z_{n})_{n}$ if we can keep the terms of the sequence as close to $Z$ as we want by keeping the index large enough.

Here "close to $Z$" means in a disk centered at $Z$
and  "as close to $Z$ as we want"
	means in a disk of as small a radius as we want.
Keep the index large enough means disregarding a finite number of terms of the sequence. The formal definition is bellow.
