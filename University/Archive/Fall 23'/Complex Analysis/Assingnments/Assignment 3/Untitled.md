Certainly, let's work through the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Start with the two-point approximation formula for the first derivative:

f′(x0)=f(x0+h)−f(x0)h−h2f′′(ξ)f′(x0​)=hf(x0​+h)−f(x0​)​−2h​f′′(ξ)

**Step 2:** Analyze the round-off errors in this formula. Consider the floating-point representation of numbers.

**Step 3:** Break down the round-off error into components:

- The subtraction of two nearly equal floating-point numbers: $f(x_0 + h)_{\text{fp}} - f(x_0)_{\text{fp}}$
- The representation of h as a floating-point number: $h_{\text{fp}}$
- The division: $\frac{\epsilon_1}{h_{\text{fp}}}$

**Step 4:** Express each of these components explicitly with their respective round-off errors:

- $f(x_0 + h)_{\text{fp}} - f(x_0)_{\text{fp}} \approx f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0) + \epsilon_1$
- $h_{\text{fp}} \approx h + \epsilon_2$
- $\frac{\epsilon_1}{h_{\text{fp}}}$

**Step 5:** Now, substitute these expressions back into the error formula and simplify it:

Round-off Error≈1h(f(x0+h)−f(x0)+ϵ1)−1h(f(x0+h)−f(x0))+ϵ1h+ϵ2Round-off Error≈h1​(f(x0​+h)−f(x0​)+ϵ1​)−h1​(f(x0​+h)−f(x0​))+h+ϵ2​ϵ1​​

**Step 6:** Continue to simplify and analyze the round-off error term, $\frac{\epsilon_1}{h + \epsilon_2}$.

**Step 7:** The optimal choice of h balances the truncation error and round-off error. To find this balance, you should consider the magnitudes of $f''(\xi)$ and the round-off error term. Unfortunately, you have limited control over $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2;$ they depend on your specific floating-point representation and hardware.

**Step 8:** To approximate $f'(2.0)$, consider the specific characteristics of your function $f(x) = x * e^x$ and how the second derivative $f''(x)$ behaves in the vicinity of $x = 2.0$. The optimal h value should be small enough to minimize truncation error but large enough to avoid excessive round-off error.

**Step 9:** Conduct practical experimentation and analysis to find the optimal h value. This may involve trying various values of h, computing the approximations for $f'(2.0)$, and analyzing the trade-off between truncation error and round-off error.

Let's work through these steps with specific values. We will assume a simple scenario without specifying actual values for the round-off errors (which depend on the hardware and floating-point representation) or $\xi$:

For simplicity, we'll denote $\Delta f = f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)$, and $\Delta f_{\text{fp}}$ as the floating-point representation of $\Delta f$. We'll similarly denote $\Delta h = h_{\text{fp}} - h$.

**Step 5:**

The round-off error term can be expressed as:

Round-off Error≈1h(Δf+ϵ1)−1hΔffp+ϵ1h+ΔhRound-off Error≈h1​(Δf+ϵ1​)−h1​Δffp​+h+Δhϵ1​​

**Step 6:**

The term $\frac{\epsilon_1}{h + \Delta h}$ represents the round-off error due to division. To minimize this error, you would need to choose a floating-point representation that provides high precision.

**Step 8:**

For the function $f(x) = x * e^x$, let's calculate $f''(x)$:

f′′(x)=ex(x+2)f′′(x)=ex(x+2)

In the vicinity of $x = 2.0$, $f''(\xi)$ will be approximately equal to $e^2 \cdot 4$ (because $\xi$ will be close to $2.0$).

Now, the optimal h value depends on the balance between truncation error and round-off error. A good starting point might be to choose a small h (e.g., h = 0.001) and a larger h (e.g., h = 0.1) and calculate the resulting round-off error for each.

You would then compare these round-off errors to the error introduced by truncation. The optimal h is the one that minimizes the total error, which is the sum of truncation error and round-off error. This analysis will help you determine the best h value for your specific problem and computational environment.

Remember that actual values for $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$, and $\xi$ would depend on your hardware and floating-point representation, so you'd need to consider the specifics of your system for a precise analysis.
