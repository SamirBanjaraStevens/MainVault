To solve the numerical analysis problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question. Let's go through each step and provide a comprehensive and extensive solution.

**Question 1**: Fitting natural cubic splines $S_j(x) = a_j + b_j(x - x_j) + c_j(x - x_j)^2 + d_j(x-x_j)^3$.

1. Simulate data from $y = \cos(x)$ for $x$ in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. Use equally spaced $x$ values. - Generate a set of equally spaced $x$ values in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. - Compute the corresponding $y$ values by evaluating $y = \cos(x)$ for each $x$.
    
2. Set up the tri-diagonal coefficient matrix $A$ for natural cubic splines. - Determine the number of data points, $n$. - Create an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with all elements initially set to 0. - Set the diagonal elements of $A$ to 2. - Set the sub-diagonal and super-diagonal elements of $A$ to 1.
    
3. Set up the $y$ vector and solve the system $Ac = y$ to obtain the $c$'s. Use scipy linalg to solve the system. - Create a vector $y$ of length $n$, where each element is the corresponding $y$ value from step 1. - Use the scipy linalg.solve function to solve the system of equations $Ac = y$ and obtain the vector $c$.
    
4. Solve for the other coefficients: $a$'s, $b$'s, and $d$'s. - Create vectors $a$, $b$, and $d$ of length $n$, initially set to 0. - Compute the $a$, $b$, and $d$ values for each spline segment using the formulas:
    
$$
\begin{align}
a_j  &= y_j \\
b_j &= \frac{y_{j+1} - y_j}{x_{j+1} - x_j} - \frac{c_j(x_{j+1} - x_j)^2}{3} - \frac{d_j(x_{j+1} - x_j)^3}{6} \\
d_j &= \frac{c_{j+1} - c_j}{3(x_{j+1} - x_j)}
\end{align}
$$
    - Solve a system of equations to obtain the $c$ values.
5. Compare the fitted coefficients with values from the scipy builtin cubic splines function for the first three splines. - Use the scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline function to fit a natural cubic spline to the simulated data. - Extract the coefficients of the first three splines from the CubicSpline object. - Compare the coefficients obtained from your own spline code with the coefficients from the CubicSpline object.
    
6. Plot the $\cos(x)$ curve and interpolate the values using a finer grid and your own spline code. - Generate a finer grid of $x$ values within the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. - Evaluate the $\cos(x)$ function for each $x$ in the finer grid. - Use your own spline code to interpolate the values of $y$ for the finer grid of $x$ values. - Plot the $\cos(x)$ curve and the interpolated values using matplotlib or any other plotting library.
    

Let's now go through each step in detail and provide the necessary work and code to solve the problem.

Step 1: Simulate data from 𝑦 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) for 𝑥 in the interval [−𝜋/2, 𝜋/2]. Use equally spaced 𝑥 values.

To simulate the data, we will generate equally spaced 𝑥 values in the interval [−𝜋/2, 𝜋/2] and compute the corresponding 𝑦 values using the cosine function.

import numpy as np

# Define the interval and number of data points
x_start = -np.pi/2
x_end = np.pi/2
n = 10  # Number of data points

# Generate equally spaced x values
x = np.linspace(x_start, x_end, n)

# Compute the corresponding y values using the cosine function
y = np.cos(x)

Step 2: Set up the tri-diagonal coefficient matrix 𝐴 for natural cubic splines.

To set up the coefficient matrix 𝐴, we need to determine the number of data points, 𝑛, and create an 𝑛 × 𝑛 matrix with the appropriate values.

import numpy as np

# Determine the number of data points
n = len(x)

# Create the coefficient matrix A
A = np.zeros((n, n))

# Set the diagonal elements to 2
np.fill_diagonal(A, 2)

# Set the sub-diagonal and super-diagonal elements to 1
np.fill_diagonal(A[1:], 1)
np.fill_diagonal(A[:, 1:], 1)

Step 3: Set up the 𝑦 vector and solve the system 𝐴𝑐 = 𝑦 to obtain the 𝑐’s. Use scipy linalg to solve the system.

To set up the 𝑦 vector, we need to create a vector of length 𝑛 where each element is the corresponding 𝑦 value from step 1. We can then use the scipy linalg.solve function to solve the system of equations 𝐴𝑐 = 𝑦 and obtain the vector 𝑐.

import scipy.linalg as linalg

# Create the y vector
y = y.reshape((-1, 1))

# Solve the system Ac = y to obtain the c's
c = linalg.solve(A, y)

Step 4: Solve for the other coefficients: 𝑎’s, 𝑏’s, and 𝑑’s.

To solve for the other coefficients, we need to compute the 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑑 values for each spline segment using the formulas provided.

# Create vectors for a, b, and d
a = y.flatten()
b = np.zeros(n)
d = np.zeros(n)

# Solve for b and d
for j in range(n-1):
    h = x[j+1] - x[j]
    b[j] = (y[j+1] - y[j]) / h - (c[j+1] + 2*c[j]) * h / 3
    d[j] = (c[j+1] - c[j]) / (3 * h)

# Print the coefficients
for j in range(n):
    print(f"Spline {j+1}: a = {a[j]}, b = {b[j]}, c = {c[j]}, d = {d[j]}")

Step 5: Compare the fitted coefficients with values from the scipy builtin cubic splines function for the first three splines.

To compare the fitted coefficients with the values from the scipy builtin cubic splines function, we can use the CubicSpline class from the scipy.interpolate module. We can create a CubicSpline object using the simulated data and extract the coefficients for the first three splines.

from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline

# Create a CubicSpline object using the simulated data
spline = CubicSpline(x, y)

# Extract the coefficients for the first three splines
coefficients = spline.c[:3]

# Print the coefficients
for j, coeff in enumerate(coefficients):
    print(f"Spline {j+1}: a = {coeff[0]}, b = {coeff[1]}, c = {coeff[2]}, d = {coeff[3]}")

Step 6: Plot the 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) curve and interpolate the values using a finer grid and your own spline code.

To plot the 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑥) curve and interpolate the values using a finer grid, we can generate a finer grid of 𝑥 values, evaluate the cosine function and the spline function for each 𝑥 value, and then plot the results using a plotting library such as matplotlib.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a finer grid of x values
x_finer = np.linspace(x_start, x_end, 100)

# Evaluate the cosine function for the finer grid
y_cosine = np.cos(x_finer)

# Evaluate the spline function for the finer grid
y_spline = spline(x_finer)

# Plot the cosine curve and the spline curve
plt.plot(x_finer, y_cosine, label='cos(x)')
plt.plot(x_finer, y_spline, label='Spline')
plt.scatter(x, y, color='red', label='Data Points')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('Fitting Natural Cubic Splines')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
