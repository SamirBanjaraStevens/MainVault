## Buspirone
Buspirone activates the same serotonin receptors as Molly 
	It is a [serotonin](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Serotonin "Serotonin") [5-HT1A receptor](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/5-HT1A_receptor "5-HT1A receptor") [agonist](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Agonist "Agonist").

If you look at the list provided below, you can see that molly activates the same receptors indirectly, while Buspirone activates directly.

Buspirone has no immediate anxiolytic effects, and hence has a delayed [onset of action](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Onset_of_action "Onset of action"); its full clinical effectiveness may require 2–4 weeks to manifest itself

Great for OCD also.

**FUN FACT**
***
	It also helps with Sexual dysfunction:
		There is some evidence that buspirone on its own may be useful in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women. 
		Buspirone may also be effective in treating antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction

For this reason, they have been proposed as augmentation agents (antidotes) or substitution agents in patients with emerging sexual dysfunction after treatment with antidepressants.

# Propranolol
Propranolol is a type of medicine called a beta blocker. 
It is used to treat different conditions in the body, such as high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats, and anxiety. 

When someone has high blood pressure, it means that their heart has to work harder to pump blood around their body. 

Propranolol helps relax the blood vessels and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood.

Propranolol can help slow down the heartbeat and make it more regular.

Another use of propranolol is for people who feel anxious or nervous in certain situations. 

It can help reduce these feelings by blocking some of the chemicals in our bodies that cause anxiety.
#### More in Depth 
***
It blocks the effects of adrenaline and other stress hormones on beta receptors in the body. It specifically targets beta-1 receptors found in the heart, which helps to reduce the heart rate and force of contraction. This results in decreased blood pressure and reduced strain on the heart. Propranolol also blocks beta-2 receptors found in other parts of the body, such as smooth muscles in blood vessels, which can help to relax and widen these vessels, further lowering blood pressure. Overall, Propranolol's mechanism of action as a beta blocker helps to regulate heart rhythm, lower blood pressure, and reduce symptoms associated with conditions like hypertension.

**BUT** <u>Propranolol is primarily used for performance anxiety</u> 
There isn't strong correlation to others except panic disorder. 

Basically, if you were a deer in the middle of the road with a f-150 coming at you with its high beams on, Propranolol (beta blocker) would allow you to mediates the flight or fight (even though you have less adrenaline lol) without panicking and make a decision, not stay still and get hit. 

But useful only in those situations where you have a ford f150 coming for your head. 
	However, i feel like this most of the time, (going to the grocery store hehehe) This can be counted as performance anxiety

Its like being high without the buzz, to be able to crack jokes at the boat party like Scoutt. 

So if you have a meeting, or if your anxiety is worse, physically and mentally, (talking to people), this will allow you to feel loose, without frying your brain.

If your doctors try to argue withyou by saying well you dont have phsyical anxiety symptoms, telll them to fuck off,  but I've heard psychologists discuss the notion that the "external" activity of the body in many cases is the origin of emotions, in a sense. Imagine turning down your bodily reactions to fear, for example; it seems likely that this would also make you less afraid.




### Cautions 
Don't get prescribed **benzodiazepines**
For physical anxiety beta blockers are useful, 
	for mental anxiety SSRI are primarily used, but... (look below)
			*Personal anecdote* 
				they had me on SSRI for autism, basically made me hate life, I became a rock with emotions. 
				meaning, i neither felt good or bad, just eh. I'm down playing eh, I meant sducidal tendencies.  
					The thing with SSRI'S is that it doesn't bring happiness, it allows you to find happiness by placing you in the middle of any spectrum, emotion etc,.
It also HEAVILLY FUCKS with your views on intimacy and actually increase sexually problems


ok so quick summary
1. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): These are commonly prescribed antidepressants that can also be effective for anxiety disorders. Examples include sertraline (Zoloft), escitalopram (Lexapro), and fluoxetine (Prozac).
    
2. Benzodiazepines: These medications are often used for short-term relief of severe anxiety or panic attacks. Examples include diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and alprazolam (Xanax). However, they can be habit-forming and have the potential for abuse, so they are typically prescribed for short periods.
    
3. Buspirone: This is a medication specifically approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It works by affecting serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain.
    
4. Beta-blockers: These medications are primarily used to treat high blood pressure but can also help with performance anxiety and certain physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heartbeat. Examples include propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol (Tenormin).


# Now the funky part. 
The reason I suggest Guanfacine is because, its great for adhd/anxiety/depression/overthinking.

*stimulate's alpha2 receptors* Like the **Buspiorine**

In women it allows brain neurons that are dulled or sub par, due to truama, if we remember them or not, to work again. Its like growing up as a kid again. 

Pros: (my experince on guanfaice)

- Intrusive thoughts have gone meaning I'm more grounded in the present, not visualising past or future anxieties as much
- Lower blood pressure and heart rate as mine was quite high
- Reduced sweating. No longer an embarassing soggy mess in 20 degree C heat
- Much less emotionally reactive
- Perceived rejection/judgement doesn't lodge itself in my brain as a permanent traumatic memory: see intrusive thoughts comment above
- Less fidgety, much calmer
- Can drink alcohol but does make me lethargic the next day
- Works great with Vyvanse
- Way less anxiety.
Way less emotional outbursts.
Less distracted.
Less forgetful.
Better at planning stuff.
Way less resistance to doing boring stuff and chores etc. (I 
	just start doing them. I’m sometimes halfway through doing a chore when I realize “I’m doing this!”).
Helps with sleep. If taken before bed it knocks you out and 
	you get a solid nights sleep (my favourite bit).

It allows/forces (hehe) me weirdly to manually breath. Like meditation.  Its literally makes you meditate while you do mundane tasks or are involved in a emotionally charged siuations, or going to grocery store.



### More on anxiety
***
The trap with anxiety is fixating on one supplement as being the miracle cure. 
	Anxiety is essential to life, and therefore not supposed to be or designed to be cured. 
		Neither should it be consistently a menace in your life.

Anxiety as a disorder is where it frequently disrupts your daily life. 
	The difference as I see it is someone without an anxiety disorder, if they suffer any anxiety at any point in their life, they can rapidly return to baseline of low level or no anxiety.

Anxiety is modulated by thoughts, it's a complicated disorder, and can express itself quite differently in individuals.

So depending on how it affects you, the question could be, will Guanfacine help me control fear extinction specifically, and/or will it assist in lowering general anxiety?

Anxiety can respond favourably to diet change, exercise, gut health and to various single or combinations of pharmaceuticals and/or supplements.

Maybe all of this is obvious.
	For some people like myself anxiety is part of my existence. 
		Something that in my lifetime with the current knowledge quite possibly something I have to manage until I'm here no more. 
			Therefore I look to strengthen areas of my life which affect anxiety and I've mentioned some of those areas above.

  
  MY TWO CENTS
 Get on Buspirone
	 - Does the job of SSRI's without frying your brain with seratonin
	 - Does the minor job of Guanfaince, 
	 - Used for general Anxiety.
Get on propranolol or metoprolol. I'd recommend propranolol, because you get more out of it, but it's only instant release. 
	why? 
		*Lemme tell you*
Here's a comparison between metoprolol and propranolol:

1. Uses:
    
    - Metoprolol: It is commonly prescribed for conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), angina (chest pain), and heart failure. It may also be used for preventing future heart attacks.
    - Propranolol: It is used for a broader range of conditions, including hypertension, angina, heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias), tremors, migraines, and certain anxiety-related symptoms like performance anxiety and stage fright. Propranolol is also used off-label for various other conditions such as essential tremor, hyperthyroidism, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
2. Selectivity:
    
    - Metoprolol: It is a selective beta-1 receptor blocker, which means it primarily targets beta-1 adrenergic receptors found in the heart.
    - Propranolol: It is a non-selective beta blocker, meaning it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Beta-2 receptors are found not only in the heart but also in other organs such as the lungs and blood vessels.
3. Lipophilicity:
    
    - Metoprolol: It is relatively more lipophilic, meaning it has a greater ability to cross cell membranes and penetrate tissues.
    - Propranolol: It is less lipophilic compared to metoprolol.
4. Duration of Action:
    
    - Metoprolol: It is available in immediate-release and extended-release formulations. The extended-release formulation provides a longer duration of action, allowing for once-daily dosing.
    - Propranolol: It is typically available in immediate-release formulations and has a relatively shorter duration of action, requiring multiple daily doses for sustained effects.
5. Additional Properties:
    
    - Metoprolol: It has some beta-1 selective blocking properties, which may make it more suitable for individuals with respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
    - Propranolol: Due to its non-selective nature, it has additional effects beyond beta-blockade. For example, it can also inhibit the release of norepinephrine, resulting in additional benefits for certain conditions like migraines and anxiety.


Quick note, extended vs Instant.

Just because some medication is extended dosent mean it takes longer to hit, it means it just last longer. 

Instant release just means it last shorter, there is no time delay mechanism using lysine.
