## Q1
Let $M$ be a $2×2$ matrix which is not invertible. 
Is it possible to change just one entry of M so that the resulting matrix is Invertible.
***
It is possible to change an entry of non-invertible matrix M so that the resulting matrix is invertible. Suppose matrix M is the the 2 x 2 matrix shown below.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Matrix M is not invertible because all entries of the bottom row and second column are zero’s. Since matrix $M$ is a n x n matrix, there should exist a matrix $B$ such that $MB = BM = I$. But for matrix $M$ given above, there exists no matrix $B$ such that $MB = I$. Multiply matrix $M$ with any random matrix $B$, it will never result in a identity matrix. Also, because $M$ is an square n x n matrix, for a particular matrix to be non invertible, $rank(M)$ is less than $n$, where $n$ is dimension and rank is dimension of it’s column space. For our given matrix $M$, $rank(M) = 1$, where $n = 2$, therefore because $rank(M)$ is less than $n$, the matrix is non invertible.

But if we were to change one entry of matrix $M$ given as such below.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Because our altered matrix $M$ is an identity matrix, there exist matrix $B$ such that $MB = I$. where Matrix $B$ can be as given below. Also, after our altercation, $rank(M) = 2$, as there are $2$ independent vectors, and $n = 2$. Because $rank(M) = n$, or $rank(M) = dim(M)$, our altered matrix $M$ is invertible.

## Q2 
Let W3 be the matrix below. Ascertain if the matrix is invertible and explain your reason- ing. If it is not, is it possible to change just one entry in W3 so that the resulting matrix is invertible? What is the minimum number of entry changes needed to attain invertibility?
***
After applying the Gauss Jordan method the reduced matrix is shown below.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The square $3 \times 3$ matrix W3 in RREF is not an identity matrix. Because the RREF of matrix W3 is not an identity matrix, there exists no matrix B such that $W3 * B = I$. Also, $rank(W3) = 2$, but $dim(W3) \text{ or } n = 3$. Because $rank(W3)$ is less than $dim(W3)$, the given matrix W3 is not-invertible.

It is possible to change just one entry of the matrix W3 to attain an invertible matrix. We can change the entry 9 to 8. 

Taking the RREF of this altered matrix, we attain an identify matrix.

Only one change was necessary to make the matrix invertible. Also $rank(W3)$ of the altered matrix is $3$, and $dim(W3)$ or $n = 3$. because $rank(W3)$ and $dim(W3)$ of the altered matrix equal 3, the altered matrix is invertible.

## Q3
Let W4 be the matrix below. Ascertain if the matrix is invertible and explain your reason- ing. If it is not, is it possible to change just one entry in W4 so that the resulting matrix is invertible? What is the minimum number of entry changes needed to attain invertibility?
***
We reduce the given matrix using the Gauss method to attain the RREF shown below.
$$
W{4} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1  &  0  &  -1 & -2 \\
0  &  1  &  2  & 3 \\
0  &  0 & 0  & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The resulting RREF matrix $W4$ is not an identity matrix, therefore, the matrix is not invertible. There exist no matrix $B$ such that $W4 * B = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Also $rank(W4) = 2$, but $dim(W4) = 4$. Therefore, since $rank(W4)$ is less than the dim(W4), the given matrix W4 is non-invertible.

One change is will not suffice 2 entry changes is required to make matrix W4 invertible. For example, the matrix shown below has 2 entry changes
$$
W4 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1  &  2  &  3  &  4 \\
5  &  6  &  7  &  8 \\
9  &  10  &  1  &  12 \\
13 & 14 & 15 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
This matrix is invertible
