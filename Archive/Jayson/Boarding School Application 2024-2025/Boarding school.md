## Questions

#### Berkshire School Supplement

1. Berkshire believes its community is strong because it is composed of individuals with different backgrounds, perspectives, values, talents, and interests who are invested in each other and the School as a whole. What is a unique attribute of your identity or personality that you feel would strengthen the Berkshire community? (minimum 250 words, maximum 500)
2. As global citizens, Berkshire values respecting, understanding, and working effectively with people who have different perspectives and experiences. Please discuss some ways in which you are interested in working towards creating an inclusive and just society. (minimum 250 words, maximum 500)
3. Each March Berkshire students experience our Pro Vita Winter Session. While some students have the opportunity to travel off campus, the majority of students participate on campus. Take some time to peruse our 2023 Pro Vita catalog and note the format in which descriptions are written: bit.ly/ProVitaCatalog2023. If you could create your very own **on-campus** Pro Vita class, what would it be? Would you take any local field trips or invite guest teachers or speakers to campus? Your task is to write a course description, title included, for your ideal **on-campus** Pro Vita class. (minimum 150 words, maximum 300)
