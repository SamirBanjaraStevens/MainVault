## Mathematical Preliminaries and Error Analysis
### Introduction

##### Def 1.1
A function $f$ defined on a set $X$ of real numbers has the **limit** $L$ at $x_{0}$ written, 
$$
\lim_{ x \to x_{0} } f(x)=L
$$
if, given any real number $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a real number $\delta > 0$ such that,
$$
\mid f(x) - L \mid < \epsilon, \text{ whenever } x \in X  \text{ and } 0 < \ \mid x-x_{0} \mid \ < \delta
$$

##### Def 1.2
Let $f$ be a function defined on a set $X$ of real and $X_{0} \in X$
Then, $f$ is **continuous**  at $x_{0}$ if 
$$
\lim_{ x \to x_{0} } f(x) = f(x_{0})
$$
The function $f$ is **continuous on the set $X$** if it is continuous at each number in $X$ 

The set of all functions that are continuous on the set $X$ is denoted $C(X)$ 
	When $X$ is an interval of the real line, the parentheses in this notation are omitted.
		For example, the set of all functions continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ is denoted $C[a,b]$ 
			The symbol $\mathbb{R}$ denoted the set of all real numbers, which also has the interval notation $(-\infty, \infty)$ 
				So the set of all functions at every real number denoted by $C(\mathbb{R})$ or by $C(-\infty, \infty)$ 

The *limit of a sequence* of real or complex numbers is defined in a similar manner. 

##### Def 1.3
Let $\{x_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be an infinite sequence of real numbers.
	This sequence has the **limit** $x$ (**converges to** $x$) if, for any $\epsilon > 0$,
	there exists a positive integer $N(\epsilon)$
	such that $\mid x_{n}-x\mid \ < \ \epsilon$
	whenever $n>N(\epsilon)$. 
		The notation 
$$
\lim_{ n \to \infty } x_{n} = x, \ \text{ or } \ x_{n} \mapsto x \ \text{ as } \ n \mapsto \infty
$$
		means that the sequence $\{x_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $x$ 

### Theorem 1.4
If $f$ is a function defined on a set $X$  o real numbers and $x_{0}\in X$, then the following statements are equivalent:
	a. $f$ is continuous at $x_{0}$ ;
	b. If $\{x_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is any sequence in $X$ converging to $x_{0}$, 
		then $\lim_{ n \to \infty } f(x_{n}) = f(x_{0})$ 

The functions we will consider when discussing numerical methods will be assumed to be continuous because this is a minimal requirement for predictable behavior

Functions that are not continuous can skip over points of interest, which can cause difficulties in attempts to approximate a solution to a problem. 

## Differentiability
#### Definition 1.5

Let $f$ be a function defined in an open interval containing $x_{0}$.
The function $f$ is **differenntiable at $x_{0}$** if 
$$
f(x_{0}) = \lim_{ x \to x_{0} } \cfrac{f(x)-f(x_{0})}{x-x_{0}}
$$
exists. The number $f'(x_{0})$ is called the the derivative of $f$ at $x_{0}$
A function that has a derivative at each number in a set $X$ is **differentiable** on $x$
The derivative of $f$ at $x_{0}$ is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $(x_{0}, f(x_{0}))$
