## Example # 1
***
Evaluate the triple integral $\iiint_{B} \ xyz^{2} \ dV$ 
	where $B$ is the rectangular box 
		given by $B=\{ (x, y, x) \mid 0\leq x\leq 1, \ -1\leq y\leq 2, \ 0\leq z \leq 3 \}$

## Example # 2
***
Evaluate $\iiint_{E} \ z \ dV$ 
	where $E$ is the solid tetrahedron
		bounded by the four planes
				$x=0$
				$y=0$
				$z=0$
				$x+y+z=1$ 

## Example # 3
***
Evaluate $\iiint_{E} \sqrt{ x^{2}+z^{2} } \ dV$ 
	where $E$ is the region 
		bounded by the paraboloid $y=x^{2}+z^{2}$
			and the plane $y=4$

## Example # 4
***
Express the iterated integral 
	$$\int _{0}^{1} \int _{0} ^{x^{2}} \int _{0}^{y} f(x, y, z) \, dz   \, dy  \, dx $$
	and then rewrite it as an iterates integral in different order
		integrating first with respect to $x$ 
			then $z$
				then $y$

## Example # 5
***
Use a triple integral to find the volume 
	of the tetrahedron $T$
		 bounded by the planes $x+2y+z=2, z=2, x=2y, x=0, x=0$

## Example # 6
***
Find the center of mass of a solid 
	of constant density
		that is bounded 
			by the parabolic cylinder $x=y^{2}$ 
				and the planes $x=z, z=0, x=1$
