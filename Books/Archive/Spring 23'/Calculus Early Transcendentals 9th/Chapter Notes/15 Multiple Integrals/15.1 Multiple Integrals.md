## Review of the Definite Integral
First let's recall the basic facts concerning definite integrals of functions of a single variable.

If $f(x)$ is defined for $a \leq x \leq b$ 
	we start dividing the interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ sub-intervals $[x_{i-1}, \ x_{i}]$ of equal width $\Delta x=\cfrac{(b-a)}{n}$ 
		and we choose sample points $x_{i}^{*}$ in these subintervals. 
			Then we frorm the Riemann Sum,
				$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x$$
			and take the limit of such sums as $n \rightarrow \infty$ 
				to obtain the definite integral of $f$ from $a$ to $b$:
$$\int _{a} ^{b} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{ n \to \infty } \sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x$$
In the special case where $f(x)\geq 0$, the Riemann Sum can be interpreted as the sum of the areas of the approximating rectangles, and $\int _{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$ represents the area unde the curve $y=f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$

## Volumes and Double Integrals
In a simillar manner we consider a function of two variables defined on a closed rectangle
$$R = [a, b] \times [c, d] = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \ \vert \ a\leq x \leq b, \ c\leq y \leq d \}$$ and we suppose that $f(x, y) \geq 0$

The graph of $f$ is a surface with the equations $z = f(x, y)$.
Let $S$ be a solid that lies above $R$ and under the graph of $f$, that is, 
$$S = \{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^{3} \ \vert \ 0 \leq z \leq f(x,y), \  (x, y)\in \text{R}\}$$
<u>Our goal is to find the volume of</u> $S$ 
***
First divide the rectangle $R$ into subrectangles.
We accomplish this by divinf the interval $[a, b]$ into $m$ sub intervals $[{x_{i-1}, x_{i}}]$ of equal width $\Delta x = \cfrac{(b-a)}{m}$
	and, dividing $[c, d]$ into $n$ subintervals $[y_{j-1}, y_{j}]$ of equal width $\Delta y = \cfrac{(d-c)}{n}$ 

By drawing lines parallel to the coordinate axis 
	through the endpoints of these subinervals (below), 
		we form the sub-rectangles each with area $\Delta A = \Delta x\Delta y$
$$R_{ij} = [x_{i-1}, x_{i}]\times[y_{i-1}, y_{j}] = \{(x, y) \ \mid \ x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_{i}, \ y_{j-1} \leq y \leq y_{j}\}$$

If we choose **Sample Point** $(x_{ij}^{*}, y_{ij}^{*})$ in each $R_{ij}$
	then we can approximate the part of the $S$ 
		that lies above each $R_{ij}$ 
			by a thin rectangular box
				with base $R_{ij}$ and height $f(x_{ij}^{*},y_{ij}^{*})$ 
The volume of this box
	is the height of the box times the ara of the base of the rectangle:
$$f(x_{ij}^{*},y_{ij}^{*})\Delta A$$

If we follow this procedure for all the rectangles
	and add the volumes of the corresponding boxes, 
		we can get an approximation to the total volume of $S$:
$$V \approx \sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f(x_{ij}^{*},y_{ij}^{*})\Delta A$$ 
This double sum means that 
	for each subrectangle
		we evalute $f$ at the chosen point
			and then add the results.

The approximation becomes better 
	as $m$ and $n$ becomes larger 
		and so, 
			$$V = \lim_{ m, n \to \infty } \sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f(x_{ij}^{*},y_{ij}^{*})\Delta A$$

This is defined as the **Volume** of the solid $S$ that lies under the graph of $f$ 
	and above rectangle $R$ 
***
Thus the **Double Integral** of $f$ over the rectangle $R$ is 
$$\tag{5}\int \int _{R} f(x, y) \ dA = \lim_{ m, n \to \infty } \sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f(x_{ij}^{*},y_{ij}^{*})\Delta A$$
if this limit exists.
***

The precise meaning of the limit above is that for every number $\epsilon>0$ there is an integer $N$ such that,
$$\left\vert\int \int _{R} f(x, y) \ dA - \sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f(x_{ij}^{*},y_{ij}^{*})\Delta A\right\vert < \epsilon$$ for all integers $m$ and $n$ greater that $N$ and for any choice of sample points $(x_{ij}^{*}, y_{ij}^{*})$ in $R_{ij}$

A function is **integrable** if the limit exist in *Equation (5)* 

If $f(x, y)\geq 0$, then the volume $V$ of the solid that lies above the rectangle $R$ and below the surface $z=f(x, y)$ is 
$$V = \int \int _{R} f(x, y) \ dA$$


The sum,
$$\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f(x_{ij}^{*},y_{ij}^{*})\Delta A$$ 
is the **Double Rieman Sum** 
	used as an approximation 
		to the value of the double integraL

If $f$ happnes to be a *positive* function,
	then the *Double Rieman Sum* represents 
		the sum of volumes of columns
			and is an approximation 
				to the volume under the graph of $f$ 


## Example 1

Estimate the volume of the solid that lies above the square $R=[0, 2]\times [0, 2]$ and below the elliptical paraboloid $z=16-x^{2}-2y^{2}$.
Divide $R$ into $4$ equal squares and choose the sample point to be the uppe rright corner of each square $R_{ij}.

#### Solution
***
The paraboloid is the graph of $f(x,y)=16-x^2-2y^{2}$ 
and the are of each square is $\Delta A=1$ 

Approximating the volume by the Riemann sum with $m=n=2$, we have 
$$
\begin{align}
V&\approx \sum_{i=1}^{2}\sum_{j=1}^{2} f(x_{i}, y_{i}) \Delta A\\
&= f(1, 1)\Delta A+ f(1,2) \Delta A + f(2,1) \Delta A +f(2,2)\Delta A\\
&= 13(1) + 7(1)+10(1)+4(1)\\
&= 34
\end{align}
$$
	this is the volume of the approximating rectangular boxes

## Example 2

If $R=\{ (x,y) \vert -1 \leq x \leq 1, \quad -2 \leq y \leq 2 \}$ 
Evaluate the integral $$\int \int _{R} \sqrt{ 1-x^{2} }  \, dA $$
#### Solution
***

It would be very difficult to evaluate this integral directly from *Equation (5)*,
	beasue $\sqrt{ 1-x^{2} }\geq 0$

We can compute the integral by interperting it as a volume.

If  $z=\sqrt{ 1-x^{2} }$ then $x^{2}+z^{2}=1$ and $z\neq 0$,
	so the given double intergal represents the volume of the solid 
		that lies below the cicular cylinder $x^{2}+z^{2}=1$
			and above the recantagle $R$

The volume of $S$ is the area of a semicircle with radius $1$ times the length of the cylinder. 

Thus, 
$$\int \int _{R} \sqrt{ 1-x^{2} }  \, dA = \cfrac{1}{2}\pi(1)^{2}\times 4 = 2\pi$$


## The Midpoint Rule

The methods that we have used for approximating single integrals 
	(Midpoint Rule, Trapezodial Rule, Simpsons Rule)
		all have counterparts for double integrals. 



We use a double Riemann sum to approzimate the double integral, 
	where the sample points $(x_{ij}^{*}, y_{ij}^{*})$ in $R_{ij}$ is chosen to be the center $(\bar{x}_{i}, \bar{y}_{i})$ of $R_{ij}$
		oin other words $\bar{x}_{i}$ is the midpoint of $[x_{i-1}, x_{i}]$ and $\bar{y}_{j}$ is the midpoiny of $[y_{j-1}, Y_{J}]$
$$\int \int _{R} f(x, y)  \, dA \approx \sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}f(\bar{x_{i}},\bar{y_{j}})\Delta A$$
	where $\bar{x}_{i}$ is the midpoint of $[x_{i-1}, x_{i}]$ and $\bar{y}_{j}$ is the midpoiny of $[y_{j-1}, Y_{J}]$


## Example 3

Use the Midpoint Rule with $m=n=2$ to estimate the value of the integral $\int \int _{R} (x-3y^{2}) \, dA$ where $R=\{ (x,y)\vert 0\leq x\leq 2, \quad 2\leq y \leq 2 \}$ 

#### Solution 
***

In using the Midpoint Rule with $m=n=2$, 
we evaluate $f(x,y) = x-3y^{2}$ at the center of the four subrectangles.
So $\bar{x}_{1}=\cfrac{1}{2}, \bar{x}_{2}=\cfrac{3}{2},  \bar{y}_{1}=\cfrac{5}{4}, \bar{y}_{2}=\cfrac{7}{4}$ 
The area of each subrectangle is $\Delta A=\cfrac{1}{2}$ 

Thus, 
$$
\begin{align}
\int \int _{R} (x-3y^{2}) \, dA &\approx \sum_{i=1}^{2}\sum_{j=1}^{2}f(\bar{x_{i}},\bar{y_{j}})\Delta A\\
&= f(\bar{x}_{1},\bar{y}_{1})\Delta A + f(\bar{x}_{1},\bar{y}_{2})\Delta A+f(\bar{x}_{2},\bar{y}_{1})\Delta A+f(\bar{x}_{2},\bar{y}_{2})\Delta A\\
&= \left(-\cfrac{67}{16}\right)\cfrac{1}{2}+\left(-\cfrac{139}{16}\right)\cfrac{1}{2}+ \left(-\cfrac{51}{16}\right)\cfrac{1}{2}+ \left(-\cfrac{123}{16}\right)\cfrac{1}{2}\\
&= -\cfrac{95}{8}
\end{align}
$$

**Note:** Interpretation of a double integral as a volume is valid only when the integrand $f$ is *positive*

Integrand in *Example 3* is not a *positive* fucntion,
	so the intergral is not a volume. 


## Iterated Integrals

Recall, that it is usually diffucullt to evaluate single integrals directly from the definition of an integral,
	but the Fundemental Theorem of Calculus provides a much easier method 

The evaluation of double integrals from first principles is even more diffucult
	but here we see how to express a double integral as an iterated integral, 
		which can then be evaluated by calcuating two single integrals

Suppose that $f$ is a function of two variables that is integrable on the rectangle $R=[a,b]\times[c, d]$
	We use the notation $\int _{c}^{d}f(x,y) \, dx$
		to mean that $x$ is held fixed and $f(x,y)$ is integrated with respect to $y$ from $y=c$ to $y=d$
	This procedure is called *partial integration with respect to $y$* 

Now, $\int _{c}^{d} f(x,y) \, dy$ is a number that depends on the value of $x$ 
	so it defines a function of $x$ 

$$A(x)=\int _{c}^{d} f(x,y) \, dy $$

If we now integrate the function $A$ with respect to $x$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$, we get 
$$\int _{a}^{b} A(x) \, dx = \int _{a}^{b} \left[\int _{c}^{d} f(x, y)  \, dy \right] \, dx $$

The integral on the RHS is called an **Iterated Integral** 

Thus,
$$\int _{a}^{b} \int _{c}^{d} f(x,y) \, dy  \, dx = \int _{a}^{b} \left[\int _{c}^{d} f(x, y)  \, dy \right] \, dx$$ 
	we first integrate with respect to $y$ from $c$ to $d$ and then with respect to $x$ from $a$ to $b$
	(work inside out)


## Example 4 

evaluate the iterated integrals 

(a) $$\int_{0}^{3} \int_{1}^{2} x^{2}y \, dy  \, dx $$
(b) $$\int _{1}^{2} \int _{0} ^{3} x^{2}y \,  dx  \, dx $$
