For a differentiable function of one variable, $y = f(x)$ 
	we define the differential $dx$ to be an independent variable
		that is, $dx$ can be given the value of any real number

The differentiable of $y$ is then defined as $$dy = f'(x)dx$$
Find the relationship between the increment $\Delta y$ and the differential $dy$ 
	$\Delta y$  - represents the change in height of the curve $y = f(x)$ and
	$dy$ - represents the change in height of the tangent line when $x$ changes by an amount $dx = \Delta x$ 

For a differentiable function of two variables $x = f(x, y)$
	We define the **differentials** $dx$ and $dy$ to be independent variables :
		that is, they can be given any values 
			then the **differential** $dz$ called the *Total differential* is defined by
			
```ad-example
title: *Total Differential* 
$$dz = f_x(x,y)dx + f_y(x,y)dy = \cfrac{\partial z}{\partial x}dx + \cfrac{\partial z}{\partial y} dy$$
```
