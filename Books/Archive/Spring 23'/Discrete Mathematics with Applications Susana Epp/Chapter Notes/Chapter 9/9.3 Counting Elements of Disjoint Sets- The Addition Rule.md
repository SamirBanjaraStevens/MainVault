## The Addition Rule

Suppose a finite set $A$ equals the union of $k$ distinct mutually disjoint subsets $A = A_{1} \cup A_{2} \cup \dots \cup A_{k}$ 

Then, 
$$N(A) = N(A_{1})+ N(A_{2})+ \dots + N(A_{k})$$


##### Counting the number of integers divisible by 5
***
How many 3 digit integers (100-999 inclusive $[100, 999]$) are divisible by 5?

Integers divisible by $5$ end in $5$ or $0$ 

Thus, the set of three digit integrs divisble by $5$ can be split into mutually disjoint subsets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ 

$$
\begin{align}
A_{1}\cup A_{2} &= \text{set of all three digit integers that are divisble by 5}\\
A_{1} \cap A_{2} &= \emptyset
\end{align}
$$


: ___             : ___                : ___
  Index 1        Index 2           Index 3
9 choices   10 choices     Ends in 0

hence, $N(A_{1}) = 9 * 10$

Same for $A_{2}$

Thus $N(A) = N(A_{1})+N(A_{2}) = 90+90$

## Formula for the Probability of the complement of an event

If $S$ is a finite sample space and $A$ is an event in $S$, then
$$P(A^{c}) = 1-P(A)$$
where $A^{c} = S - A$, the complement of $A$ in $S$

A certian computer acess password consists of $3$ through $5$ uppercase letters chosen from the 26 letters in the Roman Alphabet, with repetitions allowed.

1. How many different passwords are possible?
	- The set of all passwords can be partioned into three subsets consisting of passwords with lengths 3, 4, 5. 
	- By the addition rules, <u>the total number of passwords equals the number with length 3 plus the number with length 4, plus the number with length 5</u>
	- The multiplication rule can be used to compute the number of passwords of each length.
	- length 3 $26^{3}$
	- length 4 $26^{4}$
	- lenght 5 $26^{5}$
		- thus, total number of passwords $26^{3}+26^{4}+26^{5}=12,355,928$ 
1. How many diffrent passwords have not repeated letter?
2. How many diffrennt passwords have least one repeated letter?
3. If all passwords are equally likely, what is the probability that a randomly chosen password has at least one repeated letter?
