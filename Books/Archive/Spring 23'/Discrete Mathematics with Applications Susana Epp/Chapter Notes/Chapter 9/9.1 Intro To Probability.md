To say that a process is **Random** 
	means that when it takes place, 
		one outcome from some set of outcomes is sure to occur, 
			but is impossible to predict with certatinity which outcome that will be.


**Sample Space** - Set of all possible outcomes of a random process or experiment.
**Event** - Subset of a sample space

If experiment has finite many outcomes **and** all outcomes are equally likely to occur
- *Probability* of an event (set of outcome) is just the ratio of the number of outcomes in the event to the total number of outcomes.

$$P(E)=\cfrac{\text{the number of outcomes in E}}{\text{the total number of outcomes in S}}$$
```ad-hint
title:Notation 
For any finite set $A$, $N(A)$ denotes the number of elements in $A$
```

with this notaion, *formula* for <u>probability</u> of event becomes
$$P(E)=\cfrac{N(E)}{N(S)}$$
## Counting the Elements of a List

**Q** : How many integers are there from $5$ to $12$ ?

To answer this question, imagine going along the list of integers from $5$ to $12$ , counting each turn 

$$
\begin{align}
\underbrace{\{ 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \}}_{\text{index:}\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  \}}
\end{align}
$$
So the answer is $8$
***
More generally, if $m$ and $n$ are integers and $m\leq n$ 
	how many integers are there from $m$ through $n$?

*Note:* $n=m+(n-m)\quad \text{ where } n-m\geq 0$ (since, $n\geq m$)
		Also, the element $m+0$ is the first element of the list 
			and $m+1$ is the second
				$m+2$ is the third
					In general, the element $m+i$ is the $(i+1)^{\text{st}}$ element of the list

$$
\begin{align}
\text{list} &: &=m(=m+0) &m+1 &m+2 &\dots &n(=m+(n-m))\\
\text{count (index)} &: &1 &2 &3 &\dots &(n-m)+1\\
\end{align}
$$

And so the number of elements in the list is $n-m+1$

Basic Idea of proof:

If the list $m, m+1, \ \dots, k$ 
	has $k-m+1$ numbers

then, the list $m, m+1, \ \dots, k, k+1$ 
	has $(k-m+1)+1=(k+1)-m+1$ numbers
