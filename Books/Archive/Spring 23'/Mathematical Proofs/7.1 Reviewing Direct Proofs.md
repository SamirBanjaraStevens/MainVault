### To give a direct proof,

$$P \Rightarrow Q$$

>Assume that hypothesis is true
- >then attempt to show that the conclusion is also true

*Used if the assumption provides sufficient info to show that the conclusion is true*
*** 
The contrapositive of a given implication is logically equivalent to the implication

$$\neg{Q} \Rightarrow \neg{P}$$
if the contrapositive is proved to be true, then the implication is also true. 

## So in **Proof by Contrapositive**

>Assume $Q$ is false, then attempt to show that $P$ is false 

***
if we have a **biconditional** 
- a proof consists of proving both the implication 
- as well as its contrapositive
***

## Proof by Contradiction
***
*Helpful when attempting to prove a negative-sounding result*

Assume hypothesis is true and conclusion is false,
- then show that the conclusion was actually true.
