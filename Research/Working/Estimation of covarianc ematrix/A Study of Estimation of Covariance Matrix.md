2. Construction of linear discriminantt functions
3. Establishing independence and conditional independence
4. Setting confidence intervals on linear functions


Let $X = \{ x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n} \}$ denote a set of $p$-dimensional random vectors. 
Let $v=[v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n}]$ denote any vector v
# Expected Mean
The expected mean is 
$$
\mu=E[\tilde{x}]=v_{1}x_{1}+v_{2}x_{2}+\dots+v_{n}x_{n}
$$
where, $p$ is the probabilities of $n$ different outcomes adding to one.
# Sample Mean
The sample mean is the entry-wise average
$$
\mu_{X} = \cfrac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}
$$
# Mean of a random vector
The mean of a $p$-dimensional random vector $\tilde{x}$ is 
$$
E(\tilde{x})=
\begin{bmatrix}
E(\tilde{x}[1])\\
E(\tilde{x}[2]) \\
\vdots \\
E(\tilde{x}[p])
\end{bmatrix}
$$
# Mean of a random matrix
The mean of a $d_{1}\times d_{2}$ matrix with random entries $\tilde{X}$ is
$$
E(\tilde{X}) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
E(\tilde{x}[1,1]) & E(\tilde{x}[1,2]) & \dots & E(\tilde{x}[1,p_{2}]) \\
E(\tilde{x}[2,1]) & E(\tilde{x}[2,2]) & \dots  & E(\tilde{x}[2,p_{2}]) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
E(\tilde{x}[p_{1},1])  & E(\tilde{x}[p_{1},2]) & \dots & E(\tilde{x}[p_{1},p_{2}])
\end{bmatrix}
$$

# Covariance Matrix

The covariance matrix 

$$
\begin{align}
E_{\tilde{x}} = \Sigma_{\tilde{x}} & = E((\tilde{x}-E(\tilde{x}))-(\tilde{x}-E(\tilde{x}))^{T}) \\
 & =\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{Var}(\tilde{x}[1])  & \mathrm{Cov}(\tilde{x}[1]\tilde{x}[2]) & \dots & \mathrm{Cov}(\tilde{x}[1]\tilde{x}[p]) \\
\mathrm{Cov}(\tilde{x}[1]\tilde{x}[2]) & \mathrm{Var}(\tilde{x}[2]) & \dots & \mathrm{Cov}(\tilde{x}[2]\tilde{x}[d]) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\mathrm{Cov}(\tilde{x}[1]\tilde{x}[d])  & \mathrm{Cov}(\tilde{x}[2]\tilde{x}[d]) & \dots & \mathrm{Var}(\tilde{x}[d])

\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$
The covariance matrix encodes the variance of any liner combination of the entries of a random vector, meaning it encodes the variance of the vector in every possible direction of space.

The covariance matrix is the multidimentional analog of what in one dimension would be the variance.

# Sample Covariance matrix

The sample covariance matrix equals
$$
\begin{align}
\Sigma_{X} &= \cfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} c(x_{i})c(x_{i})^T \\
 & =\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{X[1]}^{2} & \sigma_{X[1],X[2]} & \dots & \sigma_{X[1],X[p]} \\
\sigma_{X[1],X[2]} & \sigma_{X[2]}^{2} & \dots & \sigma_{X[2],X[p]} \\
\vdots  & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\sigma_{X[1],X[p]} &\sigma_{X[2],X[p]} & \dots & \sigma_{X[p]}^{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$
where $c(x_{i})=x_{i}-\mu_X$ for $1\leq i\leq n$
and $X[j]=\{ x_{1}[j], \dots, x_{n}[j] \}$ for $1\leq j\leq p$ is the sample variance of $X[i]$,
and $\sigma_{X[i], X[j]}$ is the sample covariance of the entries of $X[i]$ and $X[j]$


***

In this case $\Sigma_{X}$ is a consistent estimator and the rate of convergence is $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Using the sample covariance matrix as an estimator has a number of advantages: simple to construct, unbiased, and intuitive. 

Unbiasedness is achieved by its expected value being equal to the population covariance matrix. 

Despite being unbiased and simple, the sample covariance matrix $\Sigma_{X}$ is a poor estimator of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ when $p$ is large compared to $n$, in the sense that $p/n\to c\in(0,\infty)$. 

Rank of $\Sigma_{X}$ is at most $n$, thus is not of full rank, so it is not invertible, even though $\Sigma$ is invertible. 

For $\Sigma=I_{p}$, the empirical spectral density - distribution of the eigenvalues - converges to large distribution. However, if $p/n\to c(0,1)$ $\Sigma_{X}$ is supported on $((1-\sqrt{ c }^{2}), (1+{\sqrt{ c }^{2}}))$ or if $\frac{p}{n}\to c >0$ the smallest and largest eigenvalues of $\Sigma_{X}$ will converge to $\mathrm{max}(0, (1-\sqrt{ c }^{2}))$ and $(1+\sqrt{ c }^{2})$ 

Thus, the larger the $\frac{p}{n}$ the more spread out the eigenvalues.

In terms of $||\cdot||_{2}$, forbinus form, $\Sigma_{X}$ is not consistent. In fact, when $p>$ we need to estimate $p\times p$ parameters based $n\times p$ observations.

So to get a good estimator, the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{p}$ must have some special form.

In general, structural assumptions of $\Sigma$ or $\Omega$ are needed for consistent estimation. 
In the following sections we will examine methods on estimating the covariance matrices in Factors Models which include regularization techniques such as tapering, banding and thresholding And other methods such as principal component method, maximum likelihood method and modified Cholesky decomposition w/regularization.

We will also be investigating estimators that assume $\Sigma$ does not have diverging eigenvalues and $n,p \to \infty$.
Focus is not on the estimators conforming to any structures on $\Sigma$, but shrinking the eigenvalues of $\Sigma_{X}$.

***
Given a random $p$-dimensional multivariate sample $X = \{ X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{n} \}$, each with finite variance $\mathrm{var(x_{t})}=\Sigma$ and expected value $E(x_{i})=0$,and covariance matrix $\Sigma_{\tilde{x}}$

$$
X_{i} = (X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \dots, X_{ip})^{T}.
$$

where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times_{1}}$.

An unbiased estimator of the $(p\times p)$ covariance matrix $\hat{\Sigma}_{p}$ is the sample covariance matrix defined on $X_{i}\sim N(0,\Sigma_{p})$, when $p$ is fixed and depend on $n$, the empirical covariance matrix (sample covarience matrix) is a good estimator. 
Where, 
$$
\begin{align}
\hat{\Sigma}_{p}&=\cfrac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}(X_{I}-\bar{X})(X_{i}\bar{X})^T\\ \\
S&=n^{-1}XX^T
\end{align}
$$


In this case, $\hat{\Sigma}_{p}$ is a consistent estimator and the rate of convergence is $n^{-1/2}$, which is optimal.

However, when $p$ is large compared to the sample size $n$, $p>n$, or depend on n, the estimator empirical covariance matrix is not accurate in the sense $p/n\to c \in(0,\infty)$.

The distribution of the eigenvalues of $S$, does not converge to a single mass. 

If $p/n\to c \in(0,1)$ and the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{p}=I$, then the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of $\hat{\Sigma}_{p}$ is supported on $((1-\sqrt{ c }^2),(1+\sqrt{ c }^2))$. 

Thus as $\frac{p}{n}$ is larger, then the eigenvalues are respectively distributed. This means in terms of $| |\cdot| |_{2}$ norms, $\hat{\Sigma}_{p}$ is not consistent.

In fact, when $p>$ we need to estimate $p\times p$ parameters based $n\times p$ observations. So to get a good estimator the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{p}$ must have some special form.
